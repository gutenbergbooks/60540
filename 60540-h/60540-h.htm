<p class="cap">Joe Kenton, tilted back in his swivel chair,
was thinking.</p>

<p>The school year was nearly over and there
were many things that he had meant to do and
hadn’t done. There was that extra course in the
spring term, there was that reading that was to
have made next year easier, there was—well, several
other things. Such as getting on better terms with
his roommate. That, too, had got by him, in spite
of all his good intentions. There was some excuse
for abandoning the extra course and the reading;
playing on the school nine hadn’t left much time
for additional work; but attaining the reputation of
being the cleverest second baseman in the history
of the school needn’t have kept him from making
up with Hal Norwin.</p>

<p>The silly part of it was that there was no apparent
reason for the estrangement. They had entered
Holman’s together last fall, and, although they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
never chummed much at home, it had seemed
natural that they should room together. But it
hadn’t worked out well. They had managed to
get along without a real quarrel, but that was the
best that could be said. And now, although no
word had been spoken of it, it was mutually understood
that next year they should separate. There
were moments when Joe regretted it. It did seem
that they should have hit it off better. Why hadn’t
they? He had nothing against Hal; or nothing
much. He did think him a bit snobbish, inclined to
make too much of the fact that his school friends
were of the “smart crowd.” And sometimes he
acted “stuck-up” about his playing. Perhaps,
though, he had a right to, for he was easily the best
man on the team, not even excepting Captain Bob
Stearns. As for his trying to get Wilder on second
instead of Joe, why, he had a right to his judgment.
Still, that rankled.</p>

<p>Perhaps, thought Joe, if he had made the effort
when he had meant to, away last autumn, they
might have got together, and life in 14 Routledge
would have been fairly jolly. Fourteen was a dandy
study. They had been lucky to get it. He wished
he could be certain of having as good a one next
fall; for, of course, he would get out and let Hal
fill his place with a more congenial roommate. In
case the trouble had been more his fault than Hal’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that would sort of make up. And speaking of Hal,
where the dickens was he?</p>

<p>The clock on his dresser said twenty-two past
eleven. At Holman’s you were required to be in
hall at ten unless you had secured leave, and even
then eleven was the limit of absence. And here it
was twenty-two minutes after! Well, Hal must
have obtained permission, for he couldn’t get in now
without ringing, and he surely wouldn’t be idiot
enough to risk a row with faculty! And yet, he
reflected as he began to undress, it wouldn’t be
unlike Hal to take a chance just at the wrong time.
He was forever doing it—and forever getting by
with it! The crowd he trained with thought it
clever to show contempt for rules and had, as Joe
well knew, a long list of unpublished escapades to
their credit; or discredit. Oh, well, he should
worry! What happened to Hal was none of his
business. He had plenty of troubles of his own;
one of which was to get the light out before
“Granny” Maynard, second floor proctor, began
his nightly snooping expedition. However, there
were still full three minutes—</p>

<p>There was a sound at the open window. A hand
slid over the sill and then the upper part of a body
appeared against the outer darkness. “Give me a
hand, Joe! That’s some climb. Thanks.” Hal
Norwin swung over the ledge, breathing hard but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
grinning in triumph. Then the grin changed to
a frown. “Rotten luck,” he continued. “I thought
maybe they’d forget to lock the door for once, but
of course they didn’t. And ‘Granny’ stuck his silly
old bean out and saw me. I beat it around back,
but I’ll bet he recognized me. Got the door locked?”</p>

<p>Joe nodded. “Yes, but we’ll have to let him in
if he comes. Funny he hasn’t been around if he
saw you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” panted Hal, “if he stays away another
ten seconds I’ll beat him.” He struggled out of his
clothes rapidly. “But if he did recognize me and
reports me—well, you know the answer; probation
for yours truly! And pro doesn’t suit me just
now; not with the Munson game the day after to-morrow.
There, now let him come! I—<em>listen</em>!”</p>

<p>There were footsteps in the corridor. Joe leaped
toward the switch. In the sudden darkness he heard
Hal’s bed creak. The footfalls came nearer. Joe,
standing silent in the darkness, listened and hoped.
Perhaps Maynard was only making his rounds,
after all. Perhaps he hadn’t seen— The steps
stopped outside. There was a moment of suspense.
Then three brisk raps sounded.</p>

<p>“Pretend you’re asleep!” whispered Hal.</p>

<p>But Joe, remembering that he was still attired in
his underclothes and that he had but the moment
before put the light out, saw the uselessness of that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Instead, he fumbled his way to the door and opened
it. The proctor stood revealed in the dim light
of the corridor.</p>

<p>“Norwin,” he began.</p>

<p>“I’m Kenton,” said Joe placidly. “What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Turn your light on, please.” Maynard pushed
past Joe into the room. The radiance showed the
apparently sleeping form of Hal, a litter of hurriedly
discarded garments about his bed and Joe but
partly undressed. Maynard viewed the motionless
form beneath the covers perplexedly. Then:</p>

<p>“Which of you came in by the window just now?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“By the window!” echoed Joe incredulously.
“What is it, a joke?”</p>

<p>“Now stop, Kenton!” Maynard raised a hand.
He was tall and thin and bespectacled, and had a
way of holding his head slightly forward from his
shoulders as he talked, perhaps because the glasses
did not quite overcome his nearsightedness. “Don’t
trouble to lie. I know what I’m talking about, for
I watched from the lavatory window and saw one
of you climb in there. And I’m pretty certain
which one it was.” He turned toward the form
huddled under the covers. “I’m sorry,” he went
on, “but I’ll have to report you. I can’t understand
your doing a crazy thing like this, though.”
His tone was indignant. “You must have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
what it meant to be caught. If you didn’t care on
your own account you ought to have realized what
it would mean to the team, to the school. Hang it,
it isn’t fair to risk defeat just for the sake of some
piffling escapade in the village!”</p>

<p>The form under the bed-clothes stirred, an arm
was thrust forth and Hal groaned sleepily. Then,
as though disturbed by the sound or the light, he
thrust the clothes down and blinked protestingly.
It was a good piece of acting. Joe wondered
whether Maynard was deceived by it. It was hard
to tell.</p>

<p>“Put out that light, Joe,” muttered Hal. Then,
wakefully: “Hello, what’s the row?”</p>

<p>Maynard viewed him doubtfully. “I think you
heard what I said,” he observed.</p>

<p>“He says he saw some one climb in our window
a while ago.” Joe nodded smilingly at the proctor.</p>

<p>Hal turned and looked at the window, blinking
and rubbing his eyes. Then: “Wh-what for?” he
asked stupidly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he said,” replied Joe gravely. “You
didn’t say, did you, Maynard?”</p>

<p>“I’ve had my say.” The proctor turned toward
the door. “I’m sorry, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Just a minute!” said Joe. “Do you still think
you saw—what you said, Maynard?”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you feel that it’s—it’s up to you to spoil
Saturday’s game?”</p>

<p>“It’s up to me to report to faculty. You should
have thought of the game before.”</p>

<p>“It seems sort of tough,” muttered Joe. Maynard
flashed a puzzled look at him. Hal sat up
impulsively.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” he began, “I suppose—”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” interrupted Joe, shrugging. “I
can stand it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“You mean—it was you?” demanded Maynard,
staring hard.</p>

<p>Joe shrugged again. “I thought you said you
knew,” he scoffed.</p>

<p>“I think I do,” replied Maynard meaningly, with
a quick side glance at Hal’s troubled face. “But I
can’t prove I’m right, I suppose. Seems to me it
would be the decent thing for one of you to own up,
though.”</p>

<p>Again Hal started to speak and again Joe
interrupted. “Oh, piffle, Maynard! A fellow’s innocent
until he’s proved guilty. Anyway, I guess
the—the circumstantial evidence is all you need.”</p>

<p>“All right, have it your way, Kenton. You know
where the evidence points. I’m sorry to have—I’m
sorry it happened. Good night.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, too,” answered Joe soberly. “Good
night, Maynard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The door closed behind the proctor and Joe
snapped off the light. After a long moment of
silence: “What did you do that for?” demanded
Hal, truculently.</p>

<p>“Well, he was sure it was one of us. If I don’t
play Saturday it won’t much matter. If you don’t,
it’ll matter a lot. You’re the only one of us who
can hit Cross, and unless some one hits him we’re
going to get licked. Besides, I didn’t lie to him.”</p>

<p>When Joe had struggled into his pajamas and
crawled into bed Hal spoke again. “Mighty decent
of you,” he said. “Don’t know that I’d have done
it for you.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t expect you to. I didn’t do it for you,
so that needn’t worry you. I did it for the team;
or the school; or maybe just because I want to
see Munson beaten.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied Hal in relieved tones. “That’s
different!” A minute later he added: “Sorry
you’re in a mess, though.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter. G’night!”</p>

<p>Doctor Whitlock seemed the next day much more
grieved than Joe. Of course, the doctor explained
gently, it meant probation for the balance of the
term, and probation meant that he wouldn’t be allowed
to take part in athletics, but in view of the
fact that Kenton had maintained good standing for
the school year and was well up near the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
his class there would be no further—ah—penalties
inflicted. Joe thanked him gravely. Outside again,
he laughed mirthlessly. Just what other penalty,
he wondered, did the principal think mattered now?</p>

<p>He and Hal had not mentioned last evening’s
incident again. For that matter, there had not been
many opportunities, for they had seen each other
but a few minutes before breakfast. While dressing
Hal had seemed morose and out of sorts. After
the interview in the office Joe returned to Number
14. He might have gone over to the field and
watched practice, and would have done so if he
hadn’t funked the explanations that would have
been required of him. There was a bad ten minutes
just at dusk when Bob Stearns came in. The
captain was hurt rather than angry and said one
or two things that made Joe want to crawl under
a bed—or weep. But he went away finally, leaving
Joe feeling very small and mean, and liking Bob
more than ever for the things he might have said
and hadn’t. Then there was another knock and
Joe’s silence didn’t protect him, for “Granny” Maynard
opened the door and descried the lone occupant
of the study in the twilight.</p>

<p>“Mind if I come in a minute, Kenton?” he asked.
“You know the fact is I feel particularly rotten
about what’s happened and I do wish it had been
some one else besides me. How bad did they treat
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not very, thanks. Pro, of course. You needn’t
feel badly, though. You only did what you had to.”</p>

<p>“I know, but—being proctor is fairly rotten sometimes.
If it wasn’t for the difference it makes in
my term bill I’d quit it. But I really can’t afford to.
I suppose you’re out of the game to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. But my being out of it won’t matter
much.”</p>

<p>“Not so much as Norwin,” said Maynard significantly.</p>

<p>“Norwin? Oh, no! Hal’s the best player we’ve
got. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“I’m not much of an authority, but I’ve heard it
said that he is.” There was a moment of silence.
“It’s none of my business, Kenton, but I must say
I think it was very decent of you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” replied the other dryly. “What?”</p>

<p>“I guess you know what I mean. I’d rather not
put it in words because—well, I’m not supposed to
know anything about it.” Maynard laughed as he
arose. “As I said before, Kenton, I’m beastly
sorry.” He held out his hand and Joe, a trifle surprised,
took it. “Hope we win to-morrow, eh?”</p>

<p>“Rather!” agreed Joe. After Maynard had gone
he frowned into the darkness beyond the open
window. “He knows. Or he thinks he knows.
Well, it doesn’t matter. Nothing does—much. I
wonder if I told Hal the truth last night, though.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Did I do it for the school or didn’t I? Of course
I want Holman’s to win, but—I don’t know! But
I’d hate to have him suspect that—that—oh, shucks,
that’s tommyrot! Why <em>should</em> I do it on his
account? Of course I didn’t! Surly brute!”</p>

<p>Hal came in a few minutes later. He didn’t see
Joe until he had turned the light on. Then:
“Hello!” he said awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Hello. How did practice go?”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess. Wilder played second.”</p>

<p>Joe nodded. “I supposed he would. That ought
to please you.”</p>

<p>“Me? Why?”</p>

<p>“You wanted him there, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Sure! With you out of it—”</p>

<p>“I mean before. Last month.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot! You tried your best to get Wilder on
second in place of me, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?” demanded Hal sternly.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know that any one exactly <em>told</em>
me. Anyhow, it didn’t matter much. He’s got
the place finally.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve been holding that in for me?” sneered
Hal. “Let me tell you, then, that I did not try to
get Wilder on second. I didn’t even want him
there. Why would I? You’re the better player.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Joe, somewhat blankly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, ‘oh!’” retorted the other. “I don’t say I
wouldn’t have tried for Wilder if I’d wanted him.
But I just didn’t. Now chew that over.”</p>

<p>“All right. But I thought—”</p>

<p>“You’re always thinking something that isn’t
so,” grumbled Hal. “I’ll bet you’re doing it right
now, too!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“You’re thinking that I—that I let you take the
blame for last night because I want to play to-morrow,”
flared Hall. “I do, but, if that was all I
wouldn’t have let you. I’m standing for it because
I know plaguey well that if I don’t play we’ll get
beaten. Oh, I dare say that sounds cocky, but it’s
so. I can hit Cross’s curves and not another one of
you fellows can come anywhere near ’em.”</p>

<p>“I know, and I’m not kicking, am I? I said it
was me because I knew we’d get ‘Finis’ written all
over us if you were out of the game. So what’s
the use of chewing the rag about it now?”</p>

<p>“Because I won’t have you think I’m a—a sneak
and a coward! And you do think so—inside.”</p>

<p>“I don’t!”</p>

<p>Hal had come close and now he stood staring
down at Joe menacingly. “You don’t?” he demanded
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“All right. <em>See</em> that you don’t. If I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
you were lying I’d—I’d knock your head off! Mind
you, I appreciate what you’ve done for me—”</p>

<p>“<em>You!</em>” shouted Joe, jumping up. “For <em>you</em>?
Don’t you dare say I did it for you! I did it because
I wanted to.” He waved a finger under the other’s
nose. “Just one more crack like that and I’ll punch
your ugly face in!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean me personally,” growled Hal.
“Anyhow, we understand each other, I guess.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>A SACRIFICE FOR KENTON</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Holman’s School had won the first contest
with Munson, and she wanted very much
to win the second and do away with the
necessity of playing a third on neutral territory.
This warm, blue-and-gold June afternoon found
them well matched and eager, how well matched is
shown by the fact that until the sixth inning neither
side scored. Then Prentiss got Holman’s first hit,
a rather scratchy affair at that, and although Cummins
was thrown out at first Prentiss reached second.
Cross, Munson’s really remarkable twirler, let down
long enough to pass Wilder and, with one down,
Holman’s cheered hopefully. “Babe” Linder flied
out to shortstop, however, and it remained for
Cochran, Holman’s left-hand pitcher, to do the trick,
or, rather, to bring it about. Cochran was no batsman,
and he knew it, just as every one else did, but
he had a wonderful faculty for getting in the way of
the ball. I’m not prepared to say that it was intentional,
but Cochran’s average was just about one base
per game owing to being struck by a pitched ball.
This time he got it on the thigh, started right off for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
first and, it may be, decided the matter for an umpire
who was inclined for an instant to be doubtful.
That filled the bases and there was a good deal of
noise from coaches and spectators, and Cross, disgruntled,
sought revenge by trying to catch Stearns
off second, or by pretending to. At all events the
ball went over the shortstop’s head, Prentiss scored
and Stearns raced for third but was caught when
the center fielder pegged a swift one to the third
sack.</p>

<p>But Munson evened things up in the eighth, just
when the home team had visions of a one-to-nothing
victory, by getting two clean hits off Cochran and
combining them with a clever steal. And at 1—1 the
game dragged—no, it never dragged for an instant.
But at 1—1 it stayed until the last of the eleventh.
Holman’s had no hope of doing anything in that
particular inning, for the tail end of her batting
list was up: Wilder, Linder, Cochran. But you
never can tell when the break will come. Wilder
was passed, Babe Linder laid down a sacrifice bunt
and Cochran, in spite of almost Herculean efforts,
took the fourth ball pitched squarely on his shoulder!
Cross complained bitterly when the rival pitcher
was waved to first, and I think the incident affected
his delivery. At all events, Torrey, left fielder and
head of the batting list, rolled one toward third
and after baseman and pitcher had each politely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
left it to the other during a tragic moment the latter
threw late to first. With bases filled, but one out
and Hal Norwin swinging his two bats as he stepped
to the plate, there could have been but one outcome.
Cross had to pitch ’em and he knew it. Perhaps
Cross already read the writing on the wall, for Hal
said afterwards that that third delivery came to
him with nothing on it but a sunbeam. He said
that it looked so good he was almost afraid of it.
Possibly Cross intended he should be. But Hal
didn’t scare quite so easily as that, and so he took
a fine healthy swing at it and it traveled. It went
straight and far and came safe to earth yards out
of reach of right fielder and to Cummins went the
honor of scoring the winning tally!</p>

<p>Joe didn’t march back to the campus with the
triumphant horde but cut across back of the gymnasium
and made his way to Number 14 in a somewhat
depressed frame of mind. He had watched
the game from start to finish and was well
satisfied at the outcome, but he hadn’t been happy.
When you have worked hard from February on
to win your position and have set your heart on
playing in the Big Game, why, you just can’t help
feeling a bit glum when the Big Game finds you
perched among the noncombatants of the grandstand.
I don’t think Joe really regretted what he
had done. One can be sad without being sorry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
But there were moments when he was rather self-contemptuous,
when he told himself that he had
done a silly, quixotic thing for which no one thanked
him.</p>

<p>They were still cheering and singing over in front
of School Hall when he reached his room, and the
sounds came to him around the corner of the building
and floated in at the open window. Although
it was nearly five o’clock the golden sunlight still
streamed across the meadows beyond the little river
and save for the disturbing and discordant sounds
from the campus the world was dreamily silent. It
was beautiful, too, with the fresh, new green of
grass and leaves and the peaceful sky and the
mellow sunlight, but he was glad that in a few more
days he would see the last of it for a while. In fact,
he wasn’t sure that he ever wanted to return to
Holman’s. He felt so horribly like a failure.</p>

<p>The shadows lengthened and the sunlight became
tinged with flame. The dormitory echoed to
laughter and the tramp of feet and the slamming of
doors. Then, presently, his own door opened and
Hal came in, bustlingly, radiating triumph and high
spirits. “Some game, Joe!” he cried. “By jiminy,
though, I thought they had us for a while! Didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Joe listlessly. “Cross was in
great form.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wasn’t he? I couldn’t get near him—until the
last inning. Well, we won, thank goodness!”</p>

<p>Joe made no answer and Hal busied himself at
the washstand. After a while: “You’re coming to
the dinner, aren’t you?” asked the latter.</p>

<p>Joe hesitated. He had forgotten that the team
would dine in state to-night in the visitors’ hall, with
speeches and songs and at the end of the modest
banquet, the election of a new captain. “I don’t
know,” he said finally. “I suppose I have a right to,
but—”</p>

<p>“Of course you have. Any fellow who has
played on the team during the season has. I asked
because—” Hal hesitated, and Joe, looking across,
saw him as near embarrassment as he ever got.
“The fact is,” he began again, and again stopped.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” said Joe. “I intend to, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Intend to what?” asked Hal, looking puzzledly
over the towel with which he was drying his face.</p>

<p>“Vote for you for captain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that! Thanks, but you needn’t if you’d
rather not. I sha’n’t mind if you don’t. That isn’t
what I was going to say, though.” He tossed the
towel aside and, hands in pockets, came over to the
window. “Look here, Joe. I haven’t been feeling
any too easy yesterday and to-day. I thought it
was all right to let you take the blame for—for my
foolishness because it might mean winning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
game to-day. And I guess it did mean that, as it’s
turned out. But I’ve sort of hated myself, just
the same, and I guess what I ought to have done
was stand the racket myself and let the game look
after <em>itself</em>. But I didn’t and post mortems don’t
get you anything. But there’s no reason for carrying
the thing any further. What we’ve got to do now
is get you squared up with faculty and the school
and—and every one. So I’m going to tell ’em the
truth at dinner to-night.”</p>

<p>“That’s a brilliant idea!” scoffed Joe.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Because there’ll be at least two
faculty there, and if you think they’ll let you accept
the captaincy after ’fessing up to that stunt you’re
all wrong.”</p>

<p>“I don’t. They’ll have me in probation to-morrow,
of course. That isn’t the question.”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s the question,” said Joe impatiently.
“You’re practically sure of the captaincy. I
know it and so do you. If faculty gets this on you
you’re a goner. Besides, what good’s it going to
do any one? School’s over in three days, and just
as long as they’re going to let me pass with my
class I don’t mind three days in bounds.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Hal stubbornly, “but
right is right. I let you suffer because I wanted
to win the game. The game’s won. Now it’s my
turn to stand the gaff.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“And lose the captaincy!”</p>

<p>Hal shrugged. “I know. I thought of that,
though. It can’t be helped. Besides—”</p>

<p>“It <em>can</em> be helped!” said Joe angrily. “All you
need to do is get this fool idea out of your head.
You talk like a—a sick fish!”</p>

<p>“Just the same—”</p>

<p>“No, sir! I won’t stand for it! What sort of
a silly fool do you think I’d feel like with you
getting up before all that bunch and—and spouting
all that rot? If you tell that yarn I’ll deny it!”</p>

<p>Hal smiled. “I can prove it, though. I can
produce five fellows who will testify that I was in
Gus Billing’s room at eleven o’clock that night.”</p>

<p>“Is <em>that</em> where you were?” asked Joe eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Why, that isn’t—there’s no harm—”</p>

<p>“Of course there’s no harm, but I stayed too
late. Gus’s clock was about an hour slow and I
never thought to look at my watch. Anyhow, it
won’t do you any good to deny it, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Well, then—” Joe spoke slowly, frowning
intently across the shadowy room. “Maybe you
sort of feel that you—you owe me something. Of
course I didn’t do it just for—just to oblige you,
but you wanted to win, and I guess I helped—”</p>

<p>“Of course I owe you something. I’m trying to
make you understand it. And I’m going to pay
what I owe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not that way,” replied Joe firmly. “If you do
want to—to square things there’s just one way
you can do it.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Hal suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Forget it!”</p>

<p>“No, sir!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean it, Hal.” Their eyes challenged.
After a moment Hal shrugged.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, “but I don’t get your idea.
It isn’t as if you’d done it for me—” He stopped
and there was a long moment of silence. Then he
asked brusquely: “You didn’t, did you?”</p>

<p>“No!” answered the other. Hal walked over,
picked up his jacket and began to put it on. “And
what if I did?” added Joe defiantly.</p>

<p>Hal stopped with one sleeve on. “I knew mighty
well you did,” he growled.</p>

<p>“You know a lot, don’t you?” grumbled Joe
sarcastically.</p>

<p>“I know that if you don’t wash up and get ready
we’ll be late,” laughed Hal. “Get a move on,
Grumpy!”</p>

<p>“Well—but no speeches, Hal!”</p>

<p>“Nary a spooch!”</p>

<p>Joe splashed and gurgled and Hal watched, grinning
broadly. Presently he observed carelessly: “I
say, Joe, we’ve only got two more days to get our
application in if we want this room next year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe dried his face with unusual care. “That’s
right,” he said at last. “Guess we’d better get busy,
eh?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Maynard fell in with Naylor, assistant manager,
on his way out. Naylor was still figuring his totals
in the official score book and Maynard peered over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“What did you give Kenton on that last play?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Kenton? Kenton wasn’t in it, you idiot! Wilder
played—”</p>

<p>“Still,” said “Granny” soberly, “I think you
should have credited him with a sacrifice.”</p>

<p>And he went on, leaving Naylor looking after
him commiseratingly.</p>

<p class="cap">Hal won the captaincy, and two days later
he and Joe and Bert Madden started for
home. About three hundred other youths
also started for home, but none of them lived in
Central City, and so, beyond the Junction, Joe and
Hal and Bert went on westward alone. Bert was
well over seventeen and would be a senior next
year, as would Hal, a year younger. Joe, who was
Hal’s age within a few months, was returning to
Holman’s in the fall as a junior. He and Hal had
been friendly at high school, and when Hal had decided
to go to Holman’s for the last two years Joe
had decided to go also. It wasn’t so easy for Joe,
however, for Joe’s folks weren’t wealthy by any
means, while Hal’s were. But he had found employment
last summer and worked hard, and, when
September had arrived, his earnings, with what
his father had been able to provide, had been sufficient
to put him through the first year.</p>

<p>It wasn’t going to be nearly so hard next fall, for
Mr. Kenton’s business had improved. Nevertheless,
Joe meant to find some sort of employment for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
summer months, and on the journey home this
matter occupied his thoughts a good deal of the
way. He couldn’t go back to Murray and Bankhead’s,
for his place there was occupied permanently
by another, but he was certain that he could find a
job of some sort. While Joe considered ways and
means, Hal was telling Bert about the good time
he was going to have at his father’s camp up north
and Bert was picturing the delights of summer life
at one of the nearby summer resorts. Hal had
invited Joe to visit the camp some time toward the
last of the summer and Joe had half accepted the
invitation. He didn’t really expect to get there
though.</p>

<p>Hal left town about a week after their return
home, and Joe missed him a good deal at first, even
though they didn’t get together very often in Central
City. Hal moved in a different circle than
Joe. Looking for work, however, occupied much
of Joe’s time during that week and the next, for
he had been home more than a fortnight before
he secured the job with Donaldson and Burns, who
operated the Central City Market. His principal
duty was to deliver by bicycle, orders that could
not await the trucks or that had been forgotten by
them. When not occupied in that way he sometimes
helped to put up orders. His hours were
from eight to five, save on Saturdays, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
store kept open until nine. Thursday afternoons
he had off, for in Central City Thursday was the
weekly half holiday from July to September.</p>

<p>It was on the first Thursday afternoon after
starting to work that he sat on an empty soap box
by the window of the stable loft and listlessly distributed
type from a “stick” in his left hand to the
case before him. The July day was hot, and from
the printing press that stood on a stout packing case
came a strong though not unpleasant odor of fresh
ink. Joe wasn’t very happy this afternoon. On
a shelf under the type case lay the results of his
recent labor, twelve printed invitations still sticky
from the press. Now, having distributed the last of
the type, he lifted one of the invitations, held it at
arm’s length and read it. Beginning in script, it
ran the gamut of Old English, italics and small
Roman, and it read as follows:</p>

<p class="noic">You are Cordially Invited<br />
to Attend a House Warming at<br />
Camp Peejay, Squirrel Lake,<br />
Thursday, July 6.<br />
Philip Levering      Joe Kenton<br />
R. S. V. P.</p>

<p>It really looked awfully well, but he couldn’t
get much of a thrill from that fact since, as sightly
as they were, those invitations would probably
never be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Until yesterday all had gone well. After work,
with Philip reading the copy, Joe had finished the
typesetting, and then, triumphantly, they had pulled
a smudgy proof and viewed it with pride and elation.
Just why at such a joyous moment the subject of
painting the camp should have crept into the conversation
is beyond knowledge, but it did, and half
an hour later the two friends had parted in enmity,
Philip flinging back as he clanged the front gate
behind him: “Then I guess there won’t be any
housewarming!” and Joe replying haughtily:
“Suits me all right!”</p>

<p>They had started the camp in April during Joe’s
week of vacation, dragging the timbers and boards
from Loomis’s mill behind Mr. Levering’s Ford.
By the end of the week it was complete even to the
two windows, and they had stood off and viewed
their work with pleasurable emotion. Everything
about it was delectable: the tar-papered roof that
smelled so gloriously in the spring sunshine, the
little four-foot, uncovered porch that ran the ten-foot
length of the front, the door that wouldn’t
quite close unless you put your full weight against
it, the little square windows—everything!</p>

<p>“Gee,” Philip had exclaimed, “it will look perfectly
corking when we get it painted!”</p>

<p>And Joe had agreed heartily. What color it was
to be painted hadn’t been discussed then. The painting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of it was to await Joe’s home coming in June.
It nearly broke their hearts that they couldn’t enjoy
their handiwork, but Joe was returning to school
the next day, and so they finally clicked the padlock
on the door and, not without many backward looks,
left the cabin behind.</p>

<p>Philip had guarded it as well as he could during
the ensuing two months, but Joe had received one
heartbroken letter from him in May in which he
told of going out to Squirrel Lake and finding the
cabin broken into and both window panes smashed.</p>

<p>“It was ‘Bull’ Jones and Harper Merrill and that
crowd that did it,” Philip had stated, “but you
can’t prove anything on them.”</p>

<p>Philip had repaired damages and when Joe got
back the last of June the cabin had not been again
molested.</p>

<p>Since then the two boys had found time to furnish
the camp. They had put in an old stove from the
Kenton attic, a table and two chairs and a camp
cot—some day they meant to have another cot—and
cooking things and tin plates and so on until the
furnishings threatened to exclude the occupants.
The housewarming idea had been Joe’s. It would,
he explained, be dandy to issue invitations and have,
say, about ten of the fellows out there for supper.
They could go out in the Fullerton bus and walk
back by moonlight. Joe wasn’t certain about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
moonlight, but he hoped for the best. Philip
accepted the idea with enthusiasm, making but one
reservation: none of Bull Jones’s crowd should be
asked! To this Joe agreed unhesitatingly, even
passionately, and that evening they had arranged a
menu for the supper, counted their cash on hand
and composed the invitations. The next day Joe had
brushed the dust from the printing press in the
stable loft and, with Philip aiding, set type, worked
the lever of the neglected press and pulled a proof.</p>

<p>Joe laid the invitations back now with a frown.
He wondered why he had gone to the trouble of
printing them, since they would never be used.
Even if he and Philip made up again later, those
cards wouldn’t be any good, for there was the date
set forth plainly: “Thursday, July 6.” And that
was only a week from to-day, and Joe was very,
very sure that he couldn’t be persuaded to forgive
Philip in any such brief space of time as a week!</p>

<p>He turned moodily away and looked out of the
window. On the Merrill’s back porch Harper and
Pete Brooks were doing something with a board
and some wire. Harper kept rabbits and perhaps
the contrivance had something to do with them.
Joe wasn’t interested, anyway. If he had been he
could easily have gained enlightenment for the porch
was only fifty feet away and the back of the house
acted like a sounding board and threw the voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of the two boys right in at the window. But Joe
was busy with his thoughts.</p>

<p>After all, he supposed it didn’t matter much
whether Camp Peejay was painted red or green.
Only, having held out for green, he wasn’t going
to give in now, especially as Philip had acted so pig-headed
and selfish. Viewing the question calmly, he
wasn’t sure that Philip’s argument was not quite
tenable. Philip had said that if they painted the
camp green it wouldn’t show up well amongst the
trees, and that, besides, red was a better color for
winter, looking warmer and more cozy. Even
before they had parted in anger, Joe had felt himself
inclining toward red, but by that time too many
things had been said! Gee, it was a mighty unimportant
thing to quarrel about! Even in the
matter of finding a name for the camp there had
been no clash of opinion, although Joe had been
secretly of the notion that, since the idea had
originated with him, Jaypee would have been more
proper, if less euphonious, than Peejay. Well, anyway,
what was done was done, and if Philip expected
that he, Joe, was going to back down and
lick his boots he was mightily mistaken! No, sir,
by jiminy! Philip could—could—</p>

<p>His indignant musings were disturbed. A new
voice, loud and compelling, came in at the window.
On the Merrill back porch Bull Jones had added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
his bulky presence to the group. Joe looked down
and scowled. Bull was a bully and a braggart, the
ringleader of the other crowd, the evil genius who
had so nearly put an end to Camp Peejay, and Joe
detested him so thoroughly that the mere sight of
him was enough to re-rumple Joe’s brow. But the
scowl of dislike gave way to one of incredulity.
Bull was outlining in perfectly audible tones a
scheme never intended for Joe’s ears! It was plain
that none of the three on the porch knew that he
was at the window. Perhaps the sunlight’s glare
masked him, or perhaps they had not thought to
look. That as may have been, Joe acted promptly.
He slid swiftly from the box, extended himself full
length on the floor, well out of sight, and listened
avidly. Fifteen minutes later, the group on the
porch having departed, he arose, abstractedly dusted
his clothes and seated himself again on the box
giving himself over to deep thought. The shaft of
sunlight moved backward the space of one dusty
floor board before Joe arrived at a course of action.
Then, guiltily conscious of wasted moments, he
seized his cap from the floor and raced down the
stairs and out into the yard. The shortest way to
Crown Street was via the side fence and the Martin’s
rhubarb patch. This route was attended by some
risk, for Mrs. Martin’s ideas on the subject of
trespass were extremely narrow, but the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
occasion seemed to Joe to warrant risk, and he took
it. Reaching the top of the board fence by means
of the grape trellis, he landed astride the bursting
crinkly head of a rhubarb plant, cast a swift and
anxious glance at the kitchen door and dodged under
the pear trees to the further side of the yard. For
once no strident voice bade him halt, and in a jiffy
he had vaulted the privet hedge and was safe.</p>

<p>Philip lived a dozen houses southward, and while
yet two doors distant Joe knew that Philip was at
home. The excruciating wail of Philip’s violin
floated sadly forth on the afternoon air. Joe smiled
as he heard. Philip’s practice hour ordinarily ended
at four, and here it was long after, and the inference
was clear that he was prolonging the agony merely
because the quarrel with his chum had left him with
no better way of spending the time. In front of
the Levering house Joe stopped and gazed frowningly
up at the open window of the room above the
porch. The practice paused for an instant and he
raised his voice in the accustomed hail:</p>

<p>“<em>Oo-ee-e-e!</em>”</p>

<p>Philip appeared at the casement and looked down.
Joe had made up his mind that if Philip’s face
showed triumph over his friend’s capitulation the
reconciliation should go no farther. But it didn’t.
Philip’s countenance expressed faint surprise, instantly
suppressed, and then casual and wary interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello!” he said.</p>

<p>“Hello!” answered Joe.</p>

<p>Philip worried the curtain cord with his bow
for a moment. Finally, after a gulp that was almost
audible below: “Come on up,” he said.</p>

<p>Joe glanced up the street and then down, as
though doubtful that his manifold interests would
permit of his accepting the invitation. In the end,
however, he nodded. “All right,” he answered.
Then, as if fearing he had shown too eager a spirit,
he added: “Got something to tell you.”</p>

<p>It was Philip’s turn to nod, and, having done so,
he disappeared from the window and Joe went, not
too hurriedly, through the gate and in at the door.
Philip awaited him, as usual, at the top of the stairway.
Each ventured a doubtful and fleeting grin as
they met, and then Philip closed the door of the
little room and Joe flung himself on the bright-hued
afghan that covered the bed by day. Having landed
there, he reflected that he had meant to comport
himself somewhat haughtily while making it clear
to his host that only a matter of extraordinary importance
would have brought him. But it was too
late now. He glanced at the violin on the chair
and then at the music rack with the bow lying along
the ledge.</p>

<p>“Practicing?” he asked.</p>

<p>Philip nodded and Joe continued mercilessly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
“Sort of late, ain’t you?” he inquired. Philip’s gaze
wandered evasively.</p>

<p>“I got started kind of late,” he murmured. Then,
realizing that the statement was not quite the truth,
he amended it. “There wasn’t much else to do,”
he said.</p>

<p>Joe stifled a triumphant chuckle. “Say,” he
substituted, “did you tell Charley Nagel about—about
the housewarming?”</p>

<p>“Kind of,” answered Philip. “I told him we were
going to ask some of the fellows out to the camp
Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Gee! Didn’t you know he’d go and tell Bull and
that bunch?”</p>

<p>“Sure! I wanted him to,” replied the other
stoutly. “After the way those fellows acted—”</p>

<p>“Well, you went and made a mess of it,” said Joe
sternly. “Bull and his crowd are going out there
to-night. They’re going to bust the door in and
use our things and have a feed!”</p>

<p>“<em>Wha-a-t!</em> How do you know?”</p>

<p>Joe told him. “Bull said they’d ‘warm the house’
for us,” he added bitterly. “They’re going to take
a steak and some onions and some ginger ale and—”</p>

<p>“Who’s going?” demanded Philip frowningly.</p>

<p>“The whole bunch: Bull and Harper and Pete
and Dill Treadway and all those. Charley Nagel,
too, I suppose. Six or seven, probably.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>Joe shrugged. “Guess they’re on the way now.
They went to get Dill and some others about half
an hour ago. Then they had to buy the steak and
things.” Joe looked at his nickel watch. “Probably
they’re just about starting. I thought you’d want
to know.”</p>

<p>Philip nodded thoughtfully. “Of course,” he
muttered. “But I guess it’s too late to do anything.
That’s a tough crowd, Joe, and they love a scrap.
Even if we could get some of our crowd to go out
there we couldn’t drive those fellows away. Gee,
I wish I hadn’t said anything to Charley!”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Joe morosely. “They’ll just
about wreck the camp! And use up all our things
too.”</p>

<p>Philip agreed gloomily. “Potatoes and coffee and
everything! If we could only get out there ahead
of them—”</p>

<p>“We can’t.”</p>

<p>Silence fell. Presently Philip arose and quietly
returned the violin to its case and relegated the
music stand to the closet. Joe watched him anxiously.
He had firm faith in Philip’s wit and
wisdom, but it seemed that here was a problem too
difficult for the chum’s solving, and Joe’s hope
languished. Outside, the evening shadows were
lengthening fast. The strident whistling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
carroty-haired youth who delivered the evening
paper grew near and there was a gentle thud as
the damp copy of the <cite>Evening Star</cite> landed against
the front door below.</p>

<p>“There’s the paper,” murmured Joe dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Get it if you like,” said Philip in abstracted tones.</p>

<p>He had seated himself again, hands in pockets
and his long legs stuck out across the faded ingrain
art-square. Joe murmured indifference to the <cite>Star</cite>
and Philip continued to stare at the floor. Five
o’clock struck from the steeple of the Presbyterian
Church and Joe instinctively listened for the screech
of the eastbound express as it reached the trestle.
But before it came Philip lifted his head suddenly
and exploded a question in the silence.</p>

<p>“What time does it get dark?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Dark? Why, about seven, I guess,” replied
Joe, startled.</p>

<p>“Think they’ll have their supper before that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Why? If they get out there by
five—”</p>

<p>“They won’t,” interrupted the other decisively.
“It’s a mile and a half. Suppose they got the crowd
rounded up and bought their things in half an hour.
They’d get started about a quarter to five. Walking,
the way they would, they’d take a good half hour
to get there. Then they’d have to get into the
cabin, and that would take them five or maybe ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
minutes longer. Well, suppose they began to prepare
supper right off, which they wouldn’t, it would
take them another half hour to make the fire and
peel the onions and all that, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Why, sure,” agreed Joe. “More than a half
hour. They’d make Charley and Dill do the work,
and they’re as slow as snails. What are you getting
at, though?”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to figure out when they’d have that
supper ready to eat. I don’t believe it would be
ready much before seven.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not, but as I’m not going to eat it, it
doesn’t mean much in my life.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you eat some of it if you had a
chance?” asked Philip, chuckling.</p>

<p>“With that gang of thugs?” retorted the other
indignantly. “I would not!”</p>

<p>“Suppose they weren’t there, though?” suggested
Philip gently.</p>

<p>“Weren’t there! Say, you’ve got a scheme!
What’s it?”</p>

<p>Philip smiled. “Maybe I have,” he answered.
“See what you think of it.”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Something like a half hour later Philip and
Joe passed out of Central City on the road
that led to Squirrel Lake. The sun was still
above the purple, hazy hills beyond the river, but it
was sinking fast. The warmth of the day was gone
and a perceptible chill lay in the shadowed reaches of
the turnpike as the chums pursued their unhurried
way. As Philip said, there was nothing to be gained
by getting to Camp Peejay before early dark, for
daylight was no factor in the successful operation of
his plan, and so they purposely walked slowly. Each
was lightly burdened, Philip with his violin case, Joe
with a bundle that was no larger and scarcely as
heavy. They had taken time to change into their
old clothes before starting. Their conversation
consisted largely of anxious calculations to determine
the probable supper hour at the camp. Philip
held stoutly that the steak and onions would not be
ready for consumption before darkness had fallen
on the banks of Squirrel Lake, while Joe chose to
be a bit pessimistic and prophesied that by the time
they got there the repast would be over with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun went down presently behind Squaw
Ridge, leaving the western sky aflame with orange
light. The shadows in the woods, on the travelers’
right, deepened. From a marsh came the harsh
croakings of frogs. A frail silver moon sailed well
above the tree tops, increasing in radiance as the
colors faded from the west. Twilight was well on
them when the two boys left the road and, proceeding
cautiously along the winding wood path, finally
came within sight of the cabin.</p>

<p>Philip halted while still a safe distance away
and set down his burden, motioning Joe to do likewise.
Ahead of them through the still barren
branches of the trees they could see the unpainted
cabin, plain against the shadows of the forest and
the steel-gray, unruffled surface of the lake. From
the window at the nearer end shone a light and from
the stovepipe that pierced the roof orange-colored
sparks floated upward to fade against the gloom
of the big pine beyond, indicating that a brisk fire
still burned in the stove. Sounds, too, reached
them as they stood there in the growing dusk; the
sound of laughter and of singing, and, once, the
unmistakable clatter of a tin dish against the stove.
Philip smiled.</p>

<p>“They haven’t eaten yet,” he whispered. “They
wouldn’t have as much of a fire if they were through
cooking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe nodded doubtful agreement and waited for
orders. Philip viewed the scene of battle with the
all-seeing eye of a general. Then: “The other
side’s best,” he whispered. “We’d better go around
at the back. Look where you’re going and, for the
love of lemons, don’t let them hear you!”</p>

<p>Began then a journey of detour that tried Joe’s
patience to the limit. The trees, young maples and
beech, with here and there a spectral birch, grew
close, and between them had crowded saplings and
bushes, and progress and silence were incompatible
from the first. Fortunately, there was so much
noise within the cabin that a little of it outside went
unheeded by the revelers, and after ten painful
minutes the conspirators reached the side of the
cabin away from the road. Again depositing their
luggage, they seated themselves behind a screening
bush and waited. It was already dusk, there in the
woods; a stone’s throw away, the lake lay placid
and shadowed, tiny wavelets lapped on the pebbles,
their sound heard, however, only in the interims
between the noises that issued through the open
window of the cabin. Presently Philip gently removed
the wrappings of the bundle and unfolded its
contents. It lay, a pallid blur, in the darkness.
Then he settled once more to the irksome task of
waiting. Through the square of window the light
of the hanging lantern within threw a path of fast-deepening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
radiance toward them. At times unrecognizable
forms shadowed the casement. From
the fact that those in the cabin still moved about
and sang, and shouted to each other above the
singing, the watchers were assured that the supper
was still in course of preparation. From Joe came
a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it dark enough yet?” he whispered.</p>

<p>Philip looked about through the forest. “Pretty
near,” he answered. “We’ll wait five minutes
longer.”</p>

<p>A hand went out and he drew the violin case
closer.</p>

<p>In the cabin, Harper Merrill lifted the larger
of the two thick steaks on a fork and peered at it
doubtfully in the dim light. “I guess this one’s
done,” he announced. “Try the potatoes, Pete.”</p>

<p>“They’re all right. Falling to pieces, some of
’em. Come on and—”</p>

<p>“Set that coffee back!” yelled Harper. “Gosh,
you fellows would stand around and not move a
hand! Find a knife, Dill, and I’ll cut this up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see but three plates,” announced Bull
Jones disgustedly. “How we going to manage?”</p>

<p>“Guess those guys didn’t plan to entertain so
soon,” chuckled Gus Baldwin, who, with Charley
Nagel, completed the company. “I’ll eat mine in
my fingers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Got the bread out?” asked Harper impatiently.
“Why don’t you open some of that ginger ale,
Bull?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t any opener, that’s why! You forgot
to ask for one.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t forget any more than you did,” Harper
replied truculently, having just singed his fingers
on the frying-pan. “I had enough to do, didn’t I?
I bought the steak and the onions—”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” exclaimed Dill. “What was that?
Listen, fellows! Shut up a minute, Harp!”</p>

<p>Comparative quiet fell and all stood motionless.
Harper with a steak held above the pan. There was
no sound save the <em>lap-lapping</em> of the wavelets. “I
don’t hear anything,” growled Bull. “What did
you think—”</p>

<p>But Bull didn’t have to conclude, for suddenly on
the stillness there came the most appalling moan
imaginable. It began low and deep and went on and
up to end in a shuddering wail of anguish, dying
away in the silence and darkness at last to leave the
six boys staring at each other with wide eyes and
tingling scalps. For a long moment after the sound
was still none moved or spoke. Then Pete Brooks
asked in a dry-lipped whisper:</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Bull shook his shoulders and laughed, but the
laugh was certainly forced. “Nothing but a cow,”
he declared loudly. “Lost her calf, maybe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“It wasn’t any cow,” protested Harper soberly.
“Besides, it came from the lake. Maybe it was a
loon!”</p>

<p>“Loons don’t make a noise like that,” said Charley
Nagel, shaking his head and looking uneasily at the
window.</p>

<p>“Well, whatever it was,” said Bull grandly, “it
cuts no ice with me. What you holding that beefsteak
up there for, Harp? Trying to cool it? Gee,
any one would think you’d seen a ghost, to look at
you!”</p>

<p>Harper smiled twistedly and put the steak back.
From the next pan came the pungent odor of
scorching onions, and he pushed the pan further
from the fire and looked about for a knife. Then
it came again!</p>

<p>It was less a moan than a high-keyed, quivery
scream this time, a scream of fear and pain that
made the listeners’ hair lift on their heads and sent
horrid cold shivers down their spines. No face
in the cabin held much color when the last intolerable
note passed sobbing away into the silence. Six
boys stared stiffly at the window. A long moment
went by. Charley Nagel sniffed then and Bull
turned to him angrily.</p>

<p>“What’s your trouble?” he demanded. “What
you scared of? Gosh, the lot of you look like you
were dying!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“You do, too,” whimpered Charley. “I—I want
to go home!” he ended in a wail.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up! Whatever it is, it’s just a—just
a noise, ain’t it? Come on, Pete! Let’s have a
look.” He took an unenthusiastic step toward the
window. Pete hung back, however. “What you
afraid of?” jeered Bull, finding courage in brow-beating
the others. “Well, I’m going to, anyway.”</p>

<p>Shamed into it, Pete followed to the end of the
little shack, and after a hesitant moment all save
Charley did likewise. At the window Bull peered
out. Before him the path of light led off into the
forest. Right and left lay only gloom and the
dimly seen trunks of trees. “Told you there wasn’t
anything,” he growled. “Some sort of owl or
something, I guess. Gee, you fellows—”</p>

<p>“<em>What’s that?</em>” stammered Pete, leaning across
his shoulder. “<em>Look!</em>”</p>

<p>Bull looked and saw. At the end of the trail of
radiance was an object that wiped away his courage
and assurance as a wet sponge effaces markings on
a slate. White and ghastly it was, wavering, uncertain;
now tall and thin, now short and broad;
but never still, its spectral bulk swaying from light
to shadow, from darkness to radiance with unearthly
motions.</p>

<p>“<em>Gosh!</em>” gasped Bull faintly.</p>

<p>Those behind pushed and shoved, holding an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
unwilling Bull at his post of observation, but they
couldn’t keep Pete any longer. With a grunt of
terror he hurled himself away and, seizing the nearest
cap from the banquet board, he pulled the door
wide and fairly hurtled through it. And as he
went his voice broke startlingly on the air.</p>

<p>“<em>Ghosts! Ghosts! Ghosts!</em>”</p>

<p>Charley Nagel wasted no time in recovering his
cap. He was but a scant three yards behind Pete
at the porch. And as he took the leap into the darkness
that horrible wail came again and put new
power into his legs! Behind him, although he knew
it not, followed four terror-stricken comrades. Bull
and Harper, the last through the doorway, reached
it together and, since the passage was narrow, hung
there for a long instant, clawing, prancing, grunting,
ere, with the desperation born of utter demoralization,
they shot through with a jar that shook the
cabin and legged it away in the darkness. In their
ears sounded that unearthly wail, that banshee cry
of fear and anguish, and their blood seemed to
freeze in their veins. Bull went fair into a tree,
bounded off with a loud grunt, rolled over twice,
picked himself up once more and after that gained
at every leap.</p>

<p>Presently the noise of crashing underbrush, the
thud-thud of flying feet died away into silence.
Once more the <em>lap-lap-lapping</em> of the little waves
was the only sound about Camp Peejay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Half an hour later Philip leaned back in his chair
and sighed with repletion. Joe reached for the
coffee pot and helped himself to a third cup of that
steaming beverage, but he did it in a half-hearted,
listless way that told its own story. Before the two
lay the sorry fragments of what had once been
two large, thick steaks, and there remained only
traces of many fried onions and boiled potatoes. Of
the dozen bottles of ginger ale but two had been
opened. The others would be presently put away
for future consideration. Philip sighed again and
pushed his tin plate further away with a gesture
that almost suggested distaste. “Gee,” he murmured,
“I’ll never be able to get home to-night!”</p>

<p>Joe nodded sympathetically. “Wish we’d told
the folks we weren’t coming,” he said. After a
moment he added: “They didn’t come back, did
they?”</p>

<p>Philip chuckled. “I knew they wouldn’t. Why,
they’re almost to town now, and I’ll bet some of
them are still running! You surely did look spooky
in that sheet, Joe! I was mighty near scared myself!”</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything,” replied Joe feelingly.
“Every time you made those sounds on your fiddle
I nearly stopped breathing! Say, what do you
suppose they thought it was?”</p>

<p>But that question had been discussed at length
already and the subject held no more interest for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Philip. Instead of offering further guesses he said:
“We’d better get those invitations posted to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Joe. There followed another long
and dreamy silence. Then Philip spoke again.</p>

<p>“Joe,” he said, carelessly, “I’ve been thinking
about painting this place and I sort of guess that
maybe it ought to be green, like you said. You
see——”</p>

<p>“Green nothing!” exclaimed the other. “Where
do you get that stuff? Red’s the only color. Now
look here——”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking maybe red would be too—too
bright——”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it! We’ll want to come here in
the winter, and we’ll want it to look—er—cheerful——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but in the summer, green——”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it’s going to be red,” declared Joe
heatedly.</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Philip, “I guess there’s no sense
having another quarrel about it! We’ll paint it red.
Now let’s get the things washed up and put the
place neat for the housewarming.”</p>

<p>It was Friday afternoon that Philip and Joe
met Pete Brooks on Common Street. Joe was for
going by with his usual curt nod, but Philip stopped
and greeted their quasi enemy affably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, Pete, we’re going to have a sort of shindig
out at the camp to-morrow afternoon. About a
dozen of us, you know. Going to have supper and
hang around awhile in the evening. Glad to have
you come if you can.”</p>

<p>Pete looked hurriedly up and down the street.
“I—I’d sure like to,” he stammered, “but—but I’ve
got something I—I’ve got to do to-morrow. Sorry!
Much obliged!”</p>

<p>He made off quickly and Philip turned a puzzled
look on his chum.</p>

<p>“Acts almost like he didn’t really want to!” he
murmured.</p>

<p>Joe thrust his arm through Philip’s again.</p>

<p>“I know it,” he agreed innocently. “Wonder
why!”</p>

<small>THE VIGILANTES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Hey, Joe! Joe Kenton!”</p>

<p>Joe swung dextrously between a big red
truck and a light delivery wagon and
slowed down at the curb, where, transferring one
foot from pedal to sidewalk, he balanced his bicycle
beside the boy who had hailed him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Sam,” he responded. “What’s it?”</p>

<p>Sam Sawyer, a likable-looking boy whose manner,
and attire, suggested a leisure not enjoyed by his
friend, smiled back. “Just wanted to see you,” he
answered. “Have some?” He proffered a bag of
peanuts. Joe dipped into it, but he frowned slightly
as he did so.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to hurry,” he said a trifle importantly.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” Sam glanced at the
wire carrier affixed to the front of the bicycle which
was piled with bundles.</p>

<p>“Temple Street,” replied Joe. “Mrs. Madden’s.
She wants these things for supper—I mean dinner.”</p>

<p>“I should think she’d order them earlier then,”
said Sam. “Say, did you hear about Warren
Scott?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe shook his head. “No. What’s it?”</p>

<p>“‘What’s it!’” mimicked the other. “They got
his wheel yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Stole it, you mean?” asked Joe interestedly.
“Who?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, you idiot. The folks who’ve been
stealing all of them, I suppose. He left it in front
of Guyers’, and when he came out it was gone.”</p>

<p>“What time was it?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Some time after school. Why?”</p>

<p>Joe frowned in a puzzled fashion for a moment.</p>

<p>“Isn’t Warren’s bicycle a Malden?” he asked
then. “Purple, with white lines?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I saw a fellow riding along Bennett Street
yesterday about a quarter to five on a wheel that
looked a lot like Warren’s. I thought, of course, it
was his, because his is the only brand-new one I’ve
seen in town, but I guess maybe it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it was!” exclaimed Sam excitedly.
“What sort of a looking fellow was he? Did you
know him?”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head. “I never saw him before, I
guess. He was about your build, only maybe a
year older, and wore dark clothes and a slouch hat.
Sort of countrified fellow, I’d say. I’d been out to
Grant Avenue with a crown roast for the Meyers,
and it was about a quarter to five when I came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Bennett Street. I was through at the store and
was going home. Bennett Street’s asphalted all
the way to Ramsey, and so I turned in there instead——”</p>

<p>“Did he look as though he was—was stealing it?”
demanded Sam eagerly.</p>

<p>“N-no, I just thought maybe Warren had loaned
it to him. I didn’t think it belonged to him, somehow.
He—he didn’t quite look like a fellow who’d
own an expensive bicycle.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ask him where he got it?”
asked Sam impatiently. “You might have known
it was Warren’s!”</p>

<p>“Well, I did think it was, but I didn’t know it
had been stolen, did I?” replied Joe slightly indignant.</p>

<p>“You might have thought of it,” said Sam, “seeing
there’s been about twenty bicycles stolen in
Central City in the last two weeks! I’ll bet I’d
have asked him mighty quick! Where do you
suppose he was going to with it? Bennett Street’s
more than two miles from Guyers’ place.”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head. “He was riding along south
when I passed him. Going sort of fast, but not like
he was in much of a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Well, say, you’d better come along to Warren’s
and tell him about it,” said Sam. “Maybe the
police can find it if we hurry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>But Joe shook his head as his alarmed glance
swept from his bundles in the carrier back over
his shoulder to the City Hall clock. “I can’t now,
Sam,” he said firmly. “I’ve got to hurry like the
dickens. I’ll go around there after I get through
at the store.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’d better tell him right now,” said Sam,
“and you can see him later. He ought to know as
soon as possible, I guess. What time do you get
through at the store?”</p>

<p>“Five, generally. Sometimes there’s a delivery
after that.”</p>

<p>“Well, say, Joe, I’ll beat it over to Warren’s and
come back to the store for you at five.”</p>

<p>Joe nodded. “All right,” he agreed. “Maybe
you’d better. I’m not sure just which house Warren
lives in. We don’t exchange visits very often,” he
added dryly. He pedaled out into the crowded
traffic of Central City’s principal business thoroughfare,
the brown-papered parcels joggling about in
the carrier, wormed his way between the two lines
of westward-bound trucks and autos, cut under the
nodding head of a big gray dray horse and turned
into Cotting Avenue. From there he could make
better time, and, since he was late, he pedaled fast.
His steed was not a very speedy one at best and it
was only by straining his leg muscles to the utmost
that he could attain a celerity that approached his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
desire. The Madden cook was a formidable woman
with an eloquent flow of language, and Joe had
no wish to start the flow!</p>

<p>Although it was well after four when he hurried
along the Madden side yard and thrust open the
kitchen door, grumbles instead of scolding awaited
him. He kept a still tongue while he placed the
parcels on top of the refrigerator and dodged quickly
out again. Ten minutes later, by following the
streets of poorer paving and scanty traffic, he was
back at the “Central City Market, Donaldson and
Burns, Proprietors,” had leaned his bicycle against
the wall beside the rear entrance and reported back
in the shipping room. On Saturdays he was on duty
until nine o’clock at night. As to-day, however,
was only Tuesday he could be measurably sure of
getting away at five or a few minutes after. To
make it more certain he kept a sharp eye on the
orders for the final delivery, with the result that
when the last box of spinach and crate of grapefruit
had been brought in from the sidewalk and
the big green curtains were down he was free to
leave.</p>

<p>He found Sam Sawyer awaiting him outside.
Sam had brought his own bicycle and as Joe wheeled
his to the street Sam said: “We’re to go right
to the police station, Joe. Warren’s going to meet
us there. He’s certain sure that was his wheel you
saw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it was,” Joe agreed. “I’ve been
thinking about it. It was new and shiny, just like
his. I guess we’d better foot it, Sam. We’ll get
there faster this time of night.”</p>

<p>Sam, who was already astride, viewed the congested
traffic of Main Street and agreed. Together,
their wheel beside them, they made a slow and
difficult passage along the sidewalk, audibly censured
by home-hurrying pedestrians. Sam, however,
managed to keep conversation going in spite of
frequent interruptions. “I guess there won’t be
many more wheels stolen after this,” he announced
confidently.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you heard about the Vigilantes?”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head. “What’s it?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“It’s a society,” replied Sam. “Sort of a secret
society. Warren got it up. Just fellows who own
wheels belong. It’s to help the police stop bicycle
thieves here in Central City, just like in some of
the bigger cities. Over in Hammon there’s been
more than two thousand dollars’ worth of bicycles
stolen since the first of the year! And I guess
there’ll be that many swiped here, too, if it isn’t
stopped pretty quick. There’s been about twenty
stolen already!”</p>

<p>“When was this society started?”</p>

<p>“Last night, at Warren’s. He got a lot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
fellows together by telephone and we put it right
through in about twenty minutes. Chief Connell
was mighty tickled when we told him about it.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Warren’s president?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is, he’s chief. I’m second chief and
‘Tilly’ Cross is——”</p>

<p>“Of course he had to have a fancy name for
it,” commented Joe.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the name?” asked Sam
indignantly. “If you knew your history——”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right, I suppose. Only Warren’s
always starting societies with funny names. Like
during the war when he got up the Junior Secret
Service and he and Talbot Fraser got pinched for
looking in someone’s window one night——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right! The fellow was a German,
wasn’t he? And even if he wasn’t a spy, he acted
mighty queer. Every one said so!”</p>

<p>“How much does it cost to get into it?”</p>

<p>“The Vigilantes? It doesn’t cost a cent. It—it’s
a patriotic organization.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it doesn’t cost anything I guess I might
go in.”</p>

<p>“We-ell—” Sam’s tones were rather flat. “Well,
you see, we’ve had to make a rule that only
fellows who owned their own wheels could join.
If we didn’t there’d be a lot of—of riff-raff want
to come in; fellows who’d want to join just for fun
or curiosity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see,” nodded Joe. “Fellows like me, you
mean.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t and you know it,” answered Sam
indignantly. “You’re all right, of course. But
you don’t own a wheel, and so—you see——”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what difference it makes whether I
own this wheel or whether Donaldson and Burns
own it. It’s just the same as if it was mine. I use
it all the time. Besides, for that matter, it mighty
near is mine now. There isn’t much left of the
original affair. I put on a new fork and new chain
and new saddle and handlebars and had the thing
mended half a dozen times because I thought that,
seeing they let me use it away from the store, it
was only fair I should keep it in shape. Gee, it was
just an old second-hand wheel when Mr. Burns
bought it. Anyway....”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Sam soothingly, “but you see
how it is, old man. Rules are rules, eh?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Joe. Then he chuckled. “Funny,
though, isn’t it, that the first fellow to do any
vigilanting should be me?”</p>

<p>“We-ell,” replied Sam, “of course we don’t
know yet that anything will come of it. That might
not have been Warren’s wheel, you see, after all.”</p>

<p>“Thought you seemed pretty certain about it
awhile back,” remarked Joe dryly. “Well, I guess I
can worry along without being a Vigilante, Sam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
At that I dare say I’ll nab as many bicycle thieves
as any of the rest of you!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Sam heartily. He didn’t
really think so, but he was glad that Joe wasn’t
offended. He liked Joe, and if it hadn’t been for
that rule he would have gladly seen him become a
member of the new society.</p>

<p>They reached the central police station just then
and wheeling their bicycles up the steps—for nowadays
there was no certainty that even the precincts
of the police station would be sacred to the thieves—they
left them in the hall and turned into the room
on the left. Warren Scott was awaiting them. He
was a tall, very good-looking fellow of eighteen, a
senior in high school and a person of prominence
there. Secretly, Joe thought Warren rather a “pill,”
but he might have been prejudiced. Their walks
of life seldom met and their acquaintance was
extremely casual. Perhaps it wouldn’t be fair to
term Warren a snob, but his father held a responsible
position with the largest industrial plant
in Central City, was a man of means and lived
accordingly, and naturally Warren found little to
connect him with a boy who, however estimable his
character might be, spent his vacation delivering
roasts of beef and bags of potatoes. This evening,
however, Warren’s manner was far more friendly.
He seemed to meet the younger boy on a footing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
social equality. Guided by a sergeant, they went into
an inner room and into the august presence of Chief
of Police Connell. The chief was corpulent, ruddy-faced,
jovial, and he accorded the chief of the
Vigilantes a most cordial welcome. To Joe it seemed
that Chief Connell was rather more amused than
impressed with the new society, but perhaps he just
imagined it. Their business was soon over with.
Joe gave his evidence clearly and, having recalled
the incident carefully during the afternoon, was
able to give a fairly good description of the presumed
bicycle thief. The chief, however, was not
very hopeful of recovering the stolen property.</p>

<p>“You see, boys,” he said, “whoever’s working the
game is pretty foxy. No one ever sees ’em at it.
Probably there’s two or three operating together.
Likely they send them off to Chicago or somewhere
like that and sell them. They don’t get back on
the market here, that’s sure. It’s easy to change a
bicycle over so’s the owner would never know it,
too. A little enamel is all they need. We haven’t
had much luck so far, boys, and that’s the truth.
Only recovered one and that was left in an alley.
Had a broken frame, and the thieves probably didn’t
want it. But now that you boys are going to help
us I guess we’ll do better.” And the chief smiled
broadly.</p>

<p>Going out, Warren thanked Joe quite nicely for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his help. “It’s too bad, though, you couldn’t remember
the fellow’s face better,” he added.</p>

<p>“He had his hat pulled down, you see,” replied
Joe. “But I guess I’d know him if I ever saw him
again.”</p>

<p>As Warren and Sam lived northward and Joe
west, the three parted outside the station.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>JOE FINDS A CLUE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Next morning’s <cite>Courier</cite>, which was Mr.
Kenton’s choice among the Central City
dailies, had a full half-column about the
Vigilantes. The <cite>Courier</cite> was quite enthusiastic, and
predicted that the end of bicycle stealing was
in sight. It gave much credit to Warren Scott,
referring to him as “the son of Mr. Lyman W.
Scott, secretary of the Sproule-Gary Corporation,
and one of Central City’s foremost citizens.” At
the end of the article it briefly announced that the
theft of two more bicycles had been reported to
the police. Joe grinned when he reached that.
“Maybe, though,” he reflected, as he hurried off,
“the thieves hadn’t heard about the Vigilantes!”</p>

<p>During the following week only one bicycle was
reported missing. Whether this was due to the
vigilance of the Vigilantes or to the fact that owners
had pretty well learned their lesson and no longer
parked their wheels beside the curb without locking
them was a question. In any case, the papers commented
favorably, praised the Vigilantes and the
Police Department—all save the <cite>Evening Star</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
which, opposed to the present city administration,
inquired loudly why the police neither apprehended
the thieves nor recovered any of the stolen property.
Sam Sawyer was very full of the honor of his
position of second chief of the Vigilantes and took
his duties very seriously. To Joe he confided that,
while the society had not so far actually caused any
arrests or returned any stolen bicycles to their owners,
it had undoubtedly to be credited with the sudden
cessation of theft. With nearly a hundred
fellows around the streets watching constantly, he
pointed out there wasn’t much chance for the robbers.</p>

<p>The following Monday the papers announced that
between Saturday evening and midnight on Sunday
eleven complaints of bicycle thefts had reached police
headquarters! Some bicycles had been stolen—locks
and all—from the curb, some had been taken from
yards and porches and one, belonging to a minister
on the outskirts of town, had been removed from
the church vestibule! The <cite>Courier</cite> had an impassioned
editorial that morning on the subject of
the revival of crime and the <cite>Star</cite> gloated and howled
in big black headings and pointed an accusing finger
in direction of Police Headquarters. Somewhat to
his disappointment, Joe did not encounter Sam that
day. Of course Joe deplored the thefts and was
sorry for those who had lost their wheels, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was only human, and he was a little bit huffed because
he had not been admitted to the Vigilantes.</p>

<p>It was nearly closing time on Tuesday when
Burke, the store manager at the Central City Market,
sought Joe in the shipping room. “There’s an
order to go out to the North Side, Joe. None of
the teams is going that way, so you’d better hustle
out on your wheel. The name’s Jordan. Smithy’s
putting it up now.”</p>

<p>Joe nodded. He didn’t relish the errand, however,
for it had been raining all day and was still at
it, and the North Side streets were none too good
under the best of weather conditions. But he made
no protest and sought Smithy. The address on the
slip read “W. H. Jordan, Orcutt Road, 1 h’se beyond
Drayton place.” Joe had to look in the
directory in the office before he could locate Orcutt
Road. The directory informed him that it ran west
from Line Street in Bowker’s Addition. With such
meager intelligence he set forth at a few minutes
past five, his carrier weighted down with bundles.</p>

<p>It was a good twenty minutes journey to Line
Street, the latter part of it through a dejected and
even unsavory part of town, and, having reached
that street, an unpaved thoroughfare sparsely inhabited
by truck farmers in a small way, he sought
further enlightenment. It was still raining desultorily
and the street was deserted by pedestrians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Finally he leaned his bicycle against a rickety fence
and pushed through a gate beyond which a small
dwelling, built largely of second-hand material,
showed in the early twilight. The man who cautiously,
even suspiciously, opened the unpainted
door to him, proved to be Italian, and Joe had much
difficulty in making his wants known. In the end,
however, he learned that Orcutt Road was nearly
a half-mile further on. The road was a veritable
quagmire now, and he was frequently forced to dismount
and push his bicycle through the muddy pools
and over the uneven roadbed. Even the dwellings
of the truck farmers ceased presently and the road—Joe
had long since stopped referring to it as a street—stretched
interminably away before him toward
the darkening horizon with little to break its monotony
save an occasional tree or group of bedraggled
bushes. Eventually, though, a tumble-down
farmhouse came into sight from under a slope of
field well away from the road, and Joe decided that
it must be the Drayton place. If it was, Orcutt
Road could not be much further. Nor was it.
Some fifty yards beyond the falling gate giving on
to the farmhouse lane, an ill-defined wagon track
led to the right and at its junction with the road a
leaning post held a board bearing the nearly illegible
inscription: “Orcutt Road.” Joe gave up the
idea of riding the bicycle any further and detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the laden carrier and set it on his shoulder. The
Jordan residence was further along the grass-grown
track than he had supposed, and he had to shift his
burden more than once before the house came into
sight.</p>

<p>It was a very humble dwelling, low, ancient,
weathered, half hidden by a plantation of tall poplars
doubtless planted many years ago as a windbreak.
There were several outbuildings visible, all
quite as unkept as the house itself. In one of
them a light burned feebly, a lemon-yellow radiance
in the gathering gloom. In the house there appeared
to be no light at all until having turned from the uncertain
road, he crossed a patch of grass and drew
nearer. Then three things happened almost simultaneously:
a dog barked ferociously from the direction
of the house, a voice challenged from nearer at
hand and a light sprang dimly into sight behind
the narrow sidelights of the entrance.</p>

<p>“You from the store?” asked the voice.</p>

<p>A dark form sprang suddenly into view a dozen
paces away and approached. So did the dog, a big
black nondescript who growled menacingly as he
bounded forward. “Get out o’ here, Gyp! Beat it
or I’ll bounce a brick off your bean!” commanded
the voice compellingly. Gyp stopped growling and
began to sniff instead, circling around the visitor at
a few yards’ distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve got an order here from the Central City
Market for Jordan,” said Joe. “All right?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered the other. “Give it to me.”
He proved to be a boy some two years older than
Joe; perhaps eighteen. He was tall and broad-shouldered
and uncouth. His clothes seemed too
large for him and fell into strange wrinkles as he
stepped close to take the wire basket. He wore no
hat, and Joe found the fact oddly worrying him for
the instant. Then, as he yielded the carrier and
said, “Four dollars and thirty cents to pay, please,”
he knew why.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the boy gruffly in his unpleasant
voice, and started toward the rear of the house,
Joe was following more slowly when the other
turned. “You wait here,” he said in a threatening
tone. “Watch him, Gyp.”</p>

<p>The dog growled and Joe stopped very still. For
several minutes boy and dog stared at each other
there in the rain and gloom, but Joe didn’t see
Gyp at all. He saw, instead, a figure in a dark
slouch hat bending over the handlebars of a shining
purple bicycle, and although the hat was now wanting,
he knew beyond the possibility of any doubt
that the youth on the bicycle and the unpleasant-voiced
boy who had disappeared beyond the corner
of the house were one and the same.</p>

<p>His thoughts were interrupted by the return of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the boy with the empty carrier and the money.
“Here you are, kid,” he grunted. “Now beat it.”</p>

<p>“Guess I’d better,” said Joe pleasantly. “It’s a
long way out here, isn’t it? Gee, I was nearly
bogged down getting along that road!”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t they send a team then?” demanded
the other.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any of them coming this way to-day.
That’s a nice dog you’ve got,” Joe snapped his
fingers invitingly, but Gyp only growled deeply. “Is
he cross?”</p>

<p>“He don’t take to strangers,” answered the other
gruffly. “Come here, Gyp. I’ll look after him till
you’re out o’ the way, kid. Better get a move on.”</p>

<p>“All right. Good night,” said Joe. He turned
back across the ragged and sodden lawn and gained
the road. There he dared one brief backward look.
Boy and dog still stood where he had left them, unmoving,
silent, two dark forms in the falling darkness.
The light in the house had gone, but that in
one of the outbuildings—possibly a stable—had increased
in brilliancy. Against its radiance a figure—two
figures—moved, coming and going from
sight across the square opening of a wide doorway.
Then Joe brought his eyes back to the uneven road
and floundered on toward the road and his bicycle.</p>

<p>His thoughts were very busy indeed as he pushed
and pedaled his way home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>It was quite dark by the time he swung into his
own street, and the infrequent lights left pockets of
gloom between them. It was in one of these that a
voice came to Joe above the swishing sound of his
tires on the wet asphalt.</p>

<p>“Hey!” said the voice imperatively. “Hold up!”</p>

<p>Joe obeyed, coming to a halt as a dark figure detached
itself from the deeper darkness across the
street. The figure resolved itself into the burly
form of a policeman who, joining the boy, peered
suspiciously from him to the bicycle.</p>

<p>“What’s it?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Whose wheel is that?” demanded the officer
gruffly.</p>

<p>“Mine,” replied Joe. “That is, it belongs to Donaldson
and Burns. They let me use it.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name? Where do you live?”</p>

<p>Joe told him, explaining his errand and indicating
the wire carrier as confirmatory evidence, and the
officer grunted as though satisfied and went on. So
did Joe, arriving home a minute later very wet and
very hungry; and also secretly rather excited. He
had difficulty getting to sleep that night.</p>

<p>The next morning three more bicycles were reported
stolen and the papers carried an advertisement
inserted by a hastily formed “Bicycle Dealers’
Association” offering a reward of one hundred
dollars for information leading to the apprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and conviction of the thieves. Joe read that notice
with a deal of interest. He would have liked a
partner in his contemplated enterprise, but the only
fellow he could think of was Sam, and there were
reasons why Sam wouldn’t answer.</p>

<p>When he reached the store Joe sought Mr. Burke
and asked to be allowed to leave a half hour earlier
to-day. The manager objected from force of habit,
but finally consented. At half-past four Joe begged
some meat trimmings from the hand butcher, detached
the parcel carrier from his bicycle and set off.</p>

<p>The afternoon was cloudy and chill, but rainless,
as he followed his route of yesterday to within sight
of the Drayton farm. There he concealed his wheel
in a clump of bushes, climbed the fence and found
himself in a meadow through which a dry brook
meandered. It was still broad daylight and the
problem of reaching the Jordan place unseen looked
difficult. He dropped into the brook, however, and,
well hunched over, began a cautious journey. The
brook crossed the meadow by many turns toward a
group of tumble-down outbuildings well away
from the Drayton house. Reaching them at last,
unchallenged, he abandoned concealment and passed
behind them toward a fence a hundred yards distant.
The fence was overgrown on both sides
with trees and bushes and he had trouble breaking
through. But when he had he was rewarded. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
quarter of a mile away to his left the Jordan house
was in sight beyond a corner of the clustered outbuildings
and between him and the latter stood a
neglected orchard overgrown with tall weeds and
littered with dead branches. Before proceeding he
reassured himself by feeling of the packet of meat in
his pocket. He was in far greater awe of Gyp than
any of the human denizens.</p>

<p>Traversing the orchard was like playing Indian.
Joe dodged from one tree to another, watching
sharply the while. As he neared the outbuildings
a sound reached him such as might be made by tapping
a metal bar with a hammer, and although it
ceased almost at once it proved that someone was
close at hand, probably in that shed where he had
yesterday seen forms moving to and fro. What he
most dreaded to hear, the challenging bark of Gyp,
didn’t disturb him. Behind the stable and sheds,
which now completely hid the dwelling, lay a mass
of discarded farm machinery, lumber and miscellaneous
rubbish half hidden by grass and bushes.
Three windows stared across at him. Of these, two
were in the shed in the middle, perhaps once a carriage
house, and the third, high up, was in the building
on the extreme left. The stable, at the right of
the row, was windowless at its rear. Joe was certain
that the center building was the one in which
he was to find an answer to his problem, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the answer would come to him by means of one of
its two windows. To reach it, however, he must
cross a good twenty yards of open space, and, while
the shadows were gathering, it was not yet even twilight,
and he hoped devoutly that no one—least of
all Gyp—would be looking his way!</p>

<p>Of course he could wait for darkness, but then
the shed might be deserted and unlighted and he
would discover nothing. No, it was best to go
ahead now and chance it. If he was discovered and
pursued he could, he thought, trust his legs to get
him out of danger. Taking a deep breath, he bent
low and ran.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE LONE CHASE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A few yards short of his goal, his foot
caught on something and Joe measured
his length with a force that almost drove
the breath from his body. Fortunately the fall had
left him in a tangle of bushes, and there he lay a
moment and listened with fast-beating heart for a
rush of footsteps. But the only sound that came to
him was that of low voices from beyond the thin
wooden wall a half-dozen feet away, and after a
cautious look about him he squirmed forward again.
To reach the nearer of the two windows he must
make his way across the remains of an abandoned
mowing machine, and that task was no slight one if
he was not to proclaim his presence to those inside.
But he managed it presently and was crouching,
his head close to the weathered boards, listening to
the voices. There were evidently at least two men in
the shed. One spoke harshly yet quite distinctly,
the other emitted only unintelligible mutterings.</p>

<p>“Kick the burlap over here, Jimmy,” said the first.
A deadened metallic sound followed, as though a
length of pipe had fallen on a carpeted floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
“There, that’s the last, ain’t it?” There came a
creaking as of carriage springs and the mutterings
of the second worker. “Yeah, I know,” went on the
other, as if in response to a suggestion, “but we’ve
got to take a chance now and then, ain’t we? Get it
covered up good and there won’t be no trouble. Better
change those number plates next thing. Huh?”
The mutterings came again and the voice which Joe
could understand broke in impatiently on them.
“Oh, you give me a pain, Jimmy! We’ve made the
trip four times, ain’t we? And we got by all right,
didn’t we? Well, then, forget the crepe-hanging!
Besides, this is the last lot, I guess. They’re getting
het up here. When they begin offering rewards it’s
a good time to move on. Huh? ... You and your
hunches. You’re always having ’em, Jimmy, and
they don’t never come true. Say, now, do they?
Where’s those plates? All right, go ahead, and
I’ll finish the load off.”</p>

<p>Something that sounded like a hammer struck
the floor with a bang and footsteps scraped about.
There was a grunt and then once more came the
noise of creaking springs. Joe, unable to restrain
his curiosity any longer, raised his head until his
eyes topped the window-sill. The pane was dusty
and draped with cobwebs, and the interior of the
shed was shadowed, but after a second spent in
accustoming his eyes to the gloom within he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that he was looking at the back of an automobile
which was standing within some four feet of the
rear wall. He was too low to see within it, although
the top was down. Nearer the floor, something
moved and the boy’s gaze lowered to a red-brown
thatch of hair, to a shoulder clad in greasy
blue denim. A squeaking sound suggested a nut
being forced tight. One of the men, probably the
one who mumbled, was changing the rear number
plate. The second man was not in sight, for the
automobile hid the rest of the shed from Joe’s view.
The squeaking ceased and suddenly the upper part
of the worker’s body shot upward within a few
inches of Joe’s eyes and the boy dropped quickly
below the window.</p>

<p>“All set,” came the voice from inside. “Let’s
eat and get going, Jimmy. It’ll be dark in an hour.
Huh? ... Oh, there ain’t no danger I’m telling
you! Ain’t we got a right to haul a load of furniture
over to Casper? Anyway, we’ll keep out of the
town this time; take it along by the river. The
roads are rotten, but we can make ’em if we don’t
hurry too much. I’m aiming to get to Chi along
about three-thirty. Best way’s to get the car unloaded
and in the yard before daylight. Come on,
let’s go.”</p>

<p>Joe listened intently. Footsteps crossed the floor,
a door banged shut, the barking of a dog came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
nearer the house. A voice called, “Slim! You,
Slim!” The dog barked louder. Voices mingled,
too indistinct, however, for Joe’s understanding. A
door slammed and quiet reigned.</p>

<p>After a moment Joe slipped quickly back to the
nearest apple tree and, making himself as small as
possible, stared thoughtfully through the head-high
crotch at the back of the shed. Low-hanging
branches concealed him and gathering twilight was
already making objects uncertain. Joe did some
hard thinking during the next five minutes. He
wanted very much to see what was in that automobile
in the shed, but the risk would be great. Even
if he managed an entrance through a window there
was the possibility of being caught by the sudden
return of one of the men. Getting out of a window
in a hurry is not always an easy matter. Besides,
he reflected, he was practically certain what he
would find if he did investigate; as certain as a
fellow could be without actually seeing. He relinquished
thought of further investigation and considered,
instead, how to circumvent the thieves.
For Joe was quite sure that they were thieves. He
was quite sure that he had found the headquarters
of the gang who had been stealing bicycles in
Central City. As he figured it out, the members
of the gang stole the wheels and brought them out
here to this deserted and almost forgotten house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and hid them away until they had enough to make a
load. Then they were placed in the automobile—having
been, perhaps, first taken down and compactly
bundled in burlap—and transported over the road
to Chicago. How many there were in the gang he
didn’t know; three, at least—not counting Gyp!
From what he had overheard, it was plain that the
men meant to make a start as soon as they had eaten
supper. Somehow, he must communicate with the
police, and that speedily. Once out of the town
there were half a dozen roads they might take, and
while by telephoning ahead, they might be intercepted
there was always the chance that they might slip
through. Whatever was to be done should be done
at once. Joe wondered if there was a telephone at
the Drayton house. He was pretty certain, though,
that there wasn’t; pretty certain, indeed, that in
coming out here he had left the last telephone pole
well over a half-mile nearer town. Therefore the
best thing to do was to get to the nearest telephone
as soon as possible and call up the police station.</p>

<p>With a last look at the shadowy bulk of the shed,
and tossing the packet of meat away, he crept back
through the orchard and climbed the fence again.
Beyond it, he sacrificed caution to speed and ran
as fast as the uneven ground would let him. As
he had suspected, no telephone wire entered the
Drayton house, nor were there any poles in sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
along the road toward which he hurried. To his disgust,
he mistook the clump of bushes where he had
hidden his bicycle and wasted more than one precious
minute finding it. At last, though, he was mounted
and pedaling hard over the lumpy, rutted road toward
the distant city.</p>

<p>Twilight was coming fast now. He wondered
how much time had elapsed since he had heard the
house door close behind the men. He had, he
figured, remained behind the shed a good minute
before returning to the orchard, and had spent
perhaps five minutes beside the tree and had
probably consumed another five minutes in reaching
the road and finding his bicycle. Consequently some
twelve minutes had already gone by. If he got his
telephone connection in another five minutes he
would be doing very well indeed, and by the time the
alarm was given nearly twenty minutes would have
elapsed. In that time, reflected Joe, the thieves
might well eat a hurried supper and start off on
their journey. They had spoken of circling the
center of the city and keeping along by the river,
and if they did the car must go slowly, for the roads
it would have to traverse were of dirt and little
traveled, save for the mile or so of parkway that
finally led to the bridge. The bridge! That was
the place to watch for them! Then Joe’s sudden
elation died a quick death. The thieves would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
their choice of three bridges, after all, or, if they
liked, could swing northward to Porterville and
cross the river by the ferry. As he sped along
making far slower progress than he desired, he
watched anxiously for signs of a telephone. He
had already covered a half-mile, he was sure, and
still no poles came to sight. A suburban road,
showing at long intervals a house of the poorer sort,
led off to the right, and Joe slowed down and considered.
This was the road the thieves would doubtless
take if they held to their plan of following the
river in its curve around the city. But there were
no telephone poles on it and so it offered no attraction
to the boy, and he was getting up speed once more
when, from behind him, came the unmistakable roar
of a motor. He looked back. Far down the road
over which he had come two white eyes of light
bored into the half darkness. Dismayed, Joe again
slowed down, stopped, placed one foot on the ground
and, undecided, waited. The approaching car came
nearer and nearer, slowed a trifle and whisked its
white orbs to the branching road. There were two
forms on the front seat and the back of the car
appeared to be piled high with furniture. Against
the lighter sky Joe caught the silhouette of table
legs stretched pathetically, helplessly upward. Then
the car was gone.</p>

<p>What Joe did then was done without reflection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Probably if he had paused long enough to reason
he would have continued on in search of the nearest
telephone. Instead, however, he switched his
bicycle about, set feet to pedals again, thump-bumped
to the corner and set off along the strange
road in pursuit of a tiny, dim red light.</p>

<p>The automobile was not going very fast now. It
couldn’t and remain in the road. Chuck-holes were
frequent and in places the roadbed was a soft and
yielding mire of wet clay and loam. Joe almost
came to grief in one such place, and, perhaps
fortunately, since what was almost a tumble drew
his gaze to the side of the road. At some not long
distant time an effort to sell house lots there had led
to the building of several blocks of concrete sidewalk.
It had apparently never paid for itself, since
few houses had been built, but there it was, and
it took but an instant for Joe to reach it. After
that for some four or five blocks he sped at full
speed, his foot on one side whisked by the encroaching
weeds, and saw to his delight that he had gained
on the more cautious car.</p>

<p>Then the concrete sidewalk gave out and he was
forced back to the road, but the red tail light was
scarcely more than a block away from him and he
didn’t doubt that from now on, until the car left
the city environs, he would be able to hang on to
it. He hoped to find a policeman to whom he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
give warning. Failing that, he could at least determine
the road taken by the thieves and so make
more certain their capture.</p>

<p>Stone paving took the place of dirt and the
automobile gathered speed. But it was evident to
Joe that the driver was seeking to avoid all suggestion
of flight. Even when still later, a stretch
of rather worn asphalt came the car did not speed
up as the pursuer feared it would, but trundled
along at a brisk yet unhurried pace. Even so,
however, it drew gradually away from Joe until,
at the end of the asphalt, it had increased its lead
to nearly three blocks. By then they were among
the factories, in a poorly lighted and, at the present
hour, well-nigh deserted part of town. A huge
grain elevator loomed beside the way, a black,
gigantic specter in the early darkness. The bicycle
bounced over the tracks of a railway spur. Between
the silent buildings a steel-gray ribbon, reflecting
an occasional light from the farther bank,
showed. The river had drawn close, and in another
minute or two Joe would know whether the car
ahead meant to continue the swing about the city
to one of the three bridges or to turn at right angles
and take the Porterville road. As he struggled on,
working desperately to bring the bicycle back to
its former place in the race, he searched for the
welcome sight of a dark blue uniform. Yet he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
none. If, he reflected indignantly, he hadn’t wanted
a policeman the street would have been full of
them! As it was, though, the corners were empty.
No gallant guardian of law and order swung a night
stick under an infrequent lamp post.</p>

<p>The railroad yard was beside him now, on his
left hand, and the sounds of shunting freight cars
and of exhausting steam reached him. Beyond a
long freight house a swinging lantern made yellow
arcs in the darkness. Then, almost before he was
aware of its proximity, the Porterville road swung
away from the cobbled thoroughfare and the red
tail light of the car ahead was whisked from sight.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>JOE RESIGNS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Instinctively Joe worked harder at the
pedals and gained the corner; was around it
before the futility of further pursuit came to
him. He looked back for sight of a policeman but
saw only the empty street. Before him stretched a
long, gradually curving road, picked out at long intervals
by lights. Far ahead now was that tiny red
speck that he had been following. Porterville was
two miles away, yet at Porterville there might be an
officer at the ferry house. At least, thought Joe,
he could give the alarm there. He was pretty tired,
more tired, indeed, than he realized, but he knew
that he was good for two miles more. He wished
devoutly that he was mounted on Sam’s light, high-geared
Arrow instead of the cumbersome heavy steed
beneath him! All these reflections had not relaxed
his efforts, and now he was well out on the Porterville
road, with the sluggish river flowing at a stone-throw
on his left. The automobile was far away,
but he could still see the tail light, and he was presently
encouraged to find that it was not gaining on
him. Perhaps even on this unfrequented road the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
thieves were not minded to attract notice by too
much speed. There was, too, as Joe had heard, a
motor policeman detailed for that stretch, and he
guessed the thieves were afraid of being halted.
The recollection of the motor policeman brought a
throb of joy to Joe. If he could find him the race
would soon be over!</p>

<p>But he didn’t find him. It seemed to Joe that to-night,
when they were needed the worst way, all
the policemen in the world had utterly vanished! In
the end he toiled into the tiny hamlet of Porterville,
to use his own expression, “just about all in.” The
car had disappeared from sight half a mile back,
but he was pretty sure that he knew where it was.
The business center of Porterville consisted of
about as many stores as there were corners at the
intersection of two streets. Of these, one showed
lights, and in front of it a handful of loiterers were
standing underneath the inscription “General Store—U.
S. Post Office.” Joe swung up to the curb,
panting hard.</p>

<p>“Say, where’s there a cop?” he demanded breathlessly.</p>

<p>No one replied for an instant. Then a tall youth
turned and hailed a man standing in the doorway.
“Hey, Gene, seen Bill Cooper lately?”</p>

<p>“Bill? Yeah, he was around about ten minutes
ago. Guess he’s down to the wharf.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“What you want him for?” inquired a third
citizen of the busy metropolis. But Joe was already
under way once more.</p>

<p>Some two hundred yards off, was the ferry house,
and even as he stepped on his pedals there came a
hoarse warning blast. He sped like mad down the
descending street. As he came to the slip there
was a jangling of bells, the gates began to close
and water was churned from the paddles of the
boat. Bill Cooper was forgotten in that instant.
Joe saw his quarry escaping and the instinct of the
chase spurred him on unthinkingly. There was
room between the closing gates to pass, although he
scraped his handle grips and then he dismounted
at a run, tossed the old wheel across a slowly widening
expanse of water and jumped.</p>

<p>He landed atop the wheel, picked himself up and
faced an irate deck hand. “What you trying to do?
Kill yourself?” demanded the man. “Don’t you
know you can’t get aboard after the gates are
closed?”</p>

<p>“They weren’t closed,” answered Joe, “—quite!”</p>

<p>“You come along o’ me and see the captain,”
replied the other. “You ain’t paid your fare, for
one thing.”</p>

<p>Joe hadn’t thought of that, and now, feeling
anxiously in a pocket, he wondered whether he was
able to. But he was, for the fare was but seventeen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
cents for him and the bicycle, and he paid it while
the burly captain growled him a lecture on boarding
the ferry after the bell had rung. That over, he
went back to the stern of the little boat, recovered
his wheel and looked about him. The <i>River Queen</i>
had a narrow cabin on each side and space between
for some six vehicles. On this trip that space was
occupied by but three, a farmer’s wagon and two
automobiles. It took but an instant to determine,
even in the dark of the unlighted tunnel, that the
foremost automobile was apparently piled with
furniture. Joe sauntered nearer. Although the tail
light appeared to have been affixed in a position
from which its rays could not possibly illumine the
number plate, the latter was decipherable with the
aid of the reflections from the car behind. Joe read
and made a mental memorandum: 21,678. The
tonneau of the car, a rather large one of good make
but an old vintage, appeared to hold only household
furniture. There was, first, a strata of mattresses,
then a bundle of bedding, a chest of drawers, the
pathetic table, a clothes basket filled with odds and
ends and other objects not to be determined. Ropes
passed and repassed over the load. In the seat ahead
the two men sat huddled and silent. Joe went
back and pondered deeply.</p>

<p>Perhaps, he thought, he should have found Bill
Cooper, as he had at first meant to do, but suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Mr. Cooper hadn’t been at the wharf? In that
case Joe would have had to hunt for him and
convince him of the truth of his strange story, by
which time the thieves would have reached the other
side, chosen their route—Joe didn’t know how many
roads might lead away from there—and secured a
good start. As it was now, he at least had the thieves
and their booty still under his eyes, and he had
thought of a plan whereby he could continue to keep
them there until the heavy hand of the Law should
descend upon them. On the whole, he concluded,
he hadn’t made a mistake. And, having reached this
encouraging conclusion, he sought the deck hand,
now recovered from his choler, and held conversation,
with the result that the bicycle was presently
stored in a locker to await Joe’s return. Then the
<i>River Queen</i> bumped into her slip, gangplanks were
hauled aboard, the automobiles came to life again,
chains rattled and the dozen or so passengers hurried
ashore.</p>

<p>Save for the ferry house and a small store, closed
and dark, this terminus of the ferry line had little
to offer. Straight ahead, a road climbed upward to
the summit of the river bluffs. To right and left
a second road followed the stream up and down.
The passengers climbed into waiting vehicles or
walked away into the gloom. Joe, one of the first
to land, stepped into the shadow of the ferry house
and waited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The first automobile creaked over the gangplank
and up the incline. As it passed, Joe ducked from
the shadow of the little building to the shadow of
the car. At its rear was a stout tire carrier occupied
by two spare tires. Joe clasped the upper rim of a
tire and swung himself up, his knees colliding painfully
with something decidedly hard and unyielding.
Unthinkingly he uttered an ejaculation of pain, but
fortunately the roar of the car as it breasted the
hill ahead drowned it. Joe squirmed himself into a
position which, if not very comfortable, was secure.
There was no danger of detection and he was certain
that he could hold on back there until Fortune,
which had so far sadly flouted him, relented. The
car rushed at the hill and took the first of it nobly.
Then, however, its speed lessened and lessened and
the driver shifted to second, and finally to
low, and the summit was gained at no more
than a snail’s pace. Once on level ground, however,
it fairly flew, and although he was to some extent
protected from the rush of the wind, Joe became
sensible of the fact that the air up here on the hills
was far colder than below in the valley. He began
to realize his weariness, too. The few minutes on
the boat had restored his breath, but they hadn’t
taken the ache from his muscles. The glamour of
excitement was waning now and he gave thought
to his position. He was a good six miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
home and he had exactly ten cents to his name. He
couldn’t return by the ferry, but would have to keep
down the river to the first bridge; and he had a
sickening notion that the first bridge was a lot
nearer ten miles away than five! Well, there was
no help for it. Having gone so far, he would see
the matter through—even if he had to keep right
on to Chicago! He would show Warren Scott and
his Vigilantes that when it came to results there
were others!</p>

<p>These musings were suddenly interrupted. The
car was slowing down! At the cost of another ache
Joe craned his head around the side of the tonneau.
A short distance ahead was a broad illumination of
white light and a blazon of red amidst it. They
were approaching a roadside filling station and were
going to stop! This, reflected Joe, was no place
for him, for the gasoline tank was under his feet.
As the car came to a pause he jumped down and
scuttled across the road and into the black shadows
of the trees.</p>

<p>From a small building beyond the pump with its
brilliant red sign atop, came a man who after an
exchange of words with the men in the car, set
about refilling the tank. Joe watched and waited
and thought hard. If he was to regain his place
he must be quick about it and yet not be seen. That
wouldn’t be so easy. If the filling station man saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
him—he broke off abruptly. His gaze, wandering
beyond the pump, had caught sight through one
lighted window of a telephone on the wall of the
little building. Why go any further? Here was
his chance. He would tell his story and get the man
to telephone to the first town beyond! A moment
later the red tail light was growing smaller down
the road and Joe was confronting the man from
the doorway, stammering badly in his eagerness.
The man stared back at him, startled.</p>

<p>“What?” he asked. “You want gas?”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head and tried again.</p>

<p>“Telephone,” he ejaculated. “Police!”</p>

<p>The man brought the chair down on all four legs
with a bump and waved a hand. “Help yourself,”
he directed. “What’s up? Accident?”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head again. “You do it,” he begged.
“I—I haven’t got enough breath!”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the other good-naturedly.
“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Telephone the nearest town,” panted the boy,
“and tell the police to stop that car, the one that
just went by here. The number’s 21,678. Tell
them it’s full of bicycles stolen in Central City,
and—”</p>

<p>The man paused with the receiver off the hook,
shook his head and laughed. “You’re crazy, kid,”
he jeered. “That car had furniture in it. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the fellows. They’ve stopped here two—three times
lately. Who’s been stringing you?”</p>

<p>“Honest, it’s so!” protested Joe. “I’ve followed
them all the way from their house. They’re bicycle
thieves. The furniture’s just to fool folks. The
bicycles are underneath. I know!”</p>

<p>The man looked less assured. “Well, that’s
funny,” he said. “Hold on, what was the number?”</p>

<p>“21,678,” answered Joe.</p>

<p>“Wrong, son. That car’s number is 5,906. I’ve
seen it two—three times and I remember. I’ve got
a habit of noticing number plates.”</p>

<p>“They changed it this evening,” said Joe. “Won’t
you please telephone?”</p>

<p>“Changed it? Well, say, I didn’t look at the
number just now. All right, but, look here, kid,
if this is some silly hoax I’ll get in a dickens of a
mess with the Winsted police! Sure you ain’t
stringing me? Sure you know what you’re talking
about?”</p>

<p>Joe nodded dumbly. The man grunted, still
doubtful, but put in the call. Then, while he waited,
he eyed Joe dubiously. “Say,” he began, “if you’re
double-crossing me—” He broke off then. “Hello!
Police Headquarters? Huh? Well, say this is
Perkins, Harry Perkins, out at the filling station
on the Bluffs Road. Yeah! Say, there’s a kid here—yeah,
young fellow—that’s right. He wants you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to stop a car that just went through here, number
21,678, he says. He says the guys in it are a couple
of thieves and that they’ve got the car filled with
bicycles swiped over in Central. Huh? Yeah,
that’s right, two, one, six, seven, eight. All right,
I’ll hold it.”</p>

<p>“Did he—is he going to do it?” asked Joe eagerly.</p>

<p>“Guess so. He told me to hold the line. Probably—hello!
What? Sure, here he is!” He
motioned Joe and put the receiver in his hand.
“Wants to talk to you,” he explained.</p>

<p>From far away came a faint, gruff voice. “Hello!
Where’d you get that story from, my boy?”</p>

<p>Joe told his tale, standing first on one foot and
then on the other, shouting loudly to convey his
certainty, to convince the unseen and evidently
somewhat incredulous official. In the end he must
have succeeded, for the official broke into a repetition
with:</p>

<p>“All right, son! You stick around there till you
hear from us. We may need you. What’s your
name? Kenton? All ri—”</p>

<p>Then silence. After a moment Joe hung up and
lifted himself painfully to a table amongst an array
of grease cans. The owner of the station eyed him
with growing curiosity. “Say, that’s some story
of yours, kid,” he said. “What were you in, a car
or a motorcycle?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bicycle,” answered Joe listlessly. Now that
the end had come he was fast losing interest in the
matter. About all he could think of was the way
his legs ached!</p>

<p>“Bicycle!” exclaimed the man. “Gee-gosh, aren’t
you tired?” Joe nodded. “Sure you are! Here,
sit in the chair, kid. I’ll say you’re a plucky one!
Gee-gosh! All that way on a bicycle! And didn’t
lose ’em!”</p>

<p>The man talked on, but Joe, his eyes closed,
perilously near asleep, didn’t really hear him: or,
at the best, he heard just occasional detached words
or phrases: “... Stopped here two—three
times ... pleasant guys ... funny, though
... always loaded with furniture ... never
noticed ... ought to hear ... police....”</p>

<p>Joe was concerned with something besides his
legs now, and that was his stomach. He had suddenly
remembered that he hadn’t had anything to
eat, except a couple of sandwiches and a banana,
since morning. Perhaps he actually did sleep for a
few moments, for he certainly didn’t hear the telephone
bell ring, and here was the filling station man
saying excitedly: “Got ’em, kid! They’re pinched
and you were dead right! The chief says the car’s
plum full of bicycles! Hey, wake up and listen!
They’ll be along pretty soon and take you home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
He says there’s a reward out and he guesses you’ll
get it!”</p>

<p>“I wish,” muttered Joe sleepily, “it was a dish
of soup and a hunk of toast and I had it now!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Hey, Joe! Joe Kenton!”</p>

<p>Joe turned his bicycle across the street and drew
up in front of Sam Sawyer. “Hello,” he said.
“What’s it?”</p>

<p>“Want to see you a minute. How’s it feel to be
a hero and have your picture in the papers and
everything?”</p>

<p>Joe grinned embarrassedly. Then he glanced at
the bundles in the carrier and frowned. “I’ve got
to hurry,” he said. “I—”</p>

<p>“Well, wait a minute, can’t you? Have you got
that reward yet?”</p>

<p>“No, but they said they would send a check to-day.
I dare say it’s over at the house now.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with it?” asked Sam,
a bit enviously.</p>

<p>Joe smiled. “Put it in the bank for the present,”
he answered. “It’s going to come in mighty handy
later. Help a lot with school expenses, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Sam. “Say, have you seen Warren
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Warren? No.” Joe glanced impatiently at the
city hall clock and from thence to the bundles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you haven’t heard?” exclaimed Sam.</p>

<p>“Guess not. What’s it?”</p>

<p>“Why, about the Vigilantes! About being a
member!”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“You! Warren called a special meeting last
evening and you were elected to membership, Joe!
Unanimously!”</p>

<p>Joe looked back unemotionally. “That so?” he
asked. “Mean that I’m a Vigilante now?”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“In good standing? All my dues paid in full?”</p>

<p>“Of course, only there aren’t any—”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” interrupted Joe, spurning the curb
with his left foot and settling in the saddle, “you
tell ’em I’ve resigned.”</p>

<p>“Resigned!” gasped Sam.</p>

<p>Joe nodded as he rolled away. “Yes, you tell
’em I’ve got me a society of my own, Sam. It’s
called the—the Go Get ’Em Society. So long!”</p>

<small>GUS BILLINGS NARRATES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">In August Hal wrote persuasively from the
north, renewing his invitation to Joe. Joe was
to come up and spend the last fortnight before
school began again, insisted Hal. With that hundred
dollars in the bank, Joe might, he reflected, allowably
treat himself to that trip; but he didn’t. It would
have cost him all of twenty dollars, to say nothing of
two weeks’ pay at Donaldson and Burns’! Instead,
Joe and Philip spent a whole five days at Camp
Peejay. That is, they went out there every evening
after Joe was through at the store and stayed until
the next morning. Then, after an early and simple
breakfast, they hurried back to town awheel, Philip
on a borrowed bicycle scarcely more presentable
than Joe’s. But they had all of Thursday out
there and spent the day fishing, later supping on
their catch of four perch and a wicked-looking hornpout.</p>

<p>The last of September saw Joe back at Holman’s
School. He and Hal had secured 14 Routledge
again and there didn’t seem to Joe much more to
ask for. Unless, of course, it was a place on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
football team. But that was probably unattainable.
Last fall he had striven hard for some sort of
recognition from the gridiron rulers and had failed.
But this year he returned with unfaltering courage,
reporting on the field the first day of practice and
never quite losing heart. As a result of perseverance—and
one or two other factors—he lasted the
season through. One of the factors was Gus Billings,
and, since the story is really Gus’s, suppose we
let Gus tell it in his own way.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me that the fellow who
wrote the story of that game for the Warrensburg
paper missed a fine chance to spring something new.
It was a pretty good story and had only about a
dozen rotten mistakes, like where it said I missed a
tackle the time their quarter got around our right
in the first period. I wasn’t in that play at all, on
account of their making the play look like it was
coming at center and me piling in behind Babe
Linder. The fellow who missed that tackle was
Pete Swanson, I guess. Anyway, it wasn’t me.
Maybe I did miss one or two, but not that one, and
that time they got nearly fifteen yards on us, and
a fellow doesn’t like to be blamed for slipping up
on a play like that.</p>

<p>Still, as I said, the story was as good as the run
of them, and the paper gave us plenty of space, just
as it generally does seeing that there are nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
three hundred of us at Holman’s and our trade’s
worth quite a bit of money to the Warrensburg
stores. But where that reporter chap fell down
was in not recognizing what you might call the
outstanding features of it and playing it up. He
could have put a corking headline on it, too; like
“Holman’s Victor in One Man Game.” But he
missed it entirely, the dumb-bell. Of course I’m
not pretending that I was on to it myself just at
the moment. It was Newt Lewis who put me on.
But I’m no news hound. If I was I’ll bet I’d turn
out better stuff than some of these reporter guys
do. It seems like some of them don’t know a football
from a Dutch cheese!</p>

<p>I suppose the story of that game really began
on Thursday night, when Babe and I were in our
room in Puffer and this Joe Kenton mooned in on
us. Babe’s real name is Gordon Fairfield Linder,
but he’s always been called Babe, even when he was
in grammar school, on account of him being so big.
Babe played center on the team, and I played right
tackle. This fellow Joe Kenton was a sort of fourth
substitute half-back. He’d been hanging on to the
squad all the season. He wasn’t much good, it
seemed, and the only reason he was still with us
was because Hop MacLean, who was captain that
year and played left half, had a bum knee and was
expected to have to give up playing any old time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
He’d got injured in the first game of the year, but
he was still playing, and playing a mighty nice
game, and I guess Joe would have been dropped
from the squad after last week’s game if Rusty
hadn’t probably forgotten about him. A coach gets
sort of muddle-headed in the last two weeks of
the season, and sort of absent-minded, too, and I
guess he was so used to seeing Joe sitting there on
the bench that he didn’t think much about him:
just thought he was part of the scenery.</p>

<p>Joe was an awfully decent sort of chap, even if
he was a dub at football, and fellows liked him
pretty well, Babe and me inclusive. He was a corking
baseball player, and you might think he’d have
been satisfied with that, but he wasn’t. He was
dead set on being a football hero, and he’d been
trying last year and this without getting very far.
It wasn’t anything unusual for him to turn up at
Number 11, but he didn’t generally come in looking
like he was rehearsing to be a pallbearer at some
one’s funeral. Babe, who had grabbed up a Latin
book, thinking it might be one of the faculty, tossed
it back on the table and picked up his magazine again
and grunted “’Lo, Joe.” And I said “’Lo,” too,
and asked who was dead; and Joe sort of groaned
and dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>“I’m up against it, fellows,” he said dismally.</p>

<p>“Spill it,” said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>He pulled a letter out of a pocket and tossed it
to me. “Read it,” said he.</p>

<p>So I pulled the thing out of the envelope and
started. It was dated “Central City, Nov. 12.”
Central City is where Joe lives.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Joseph</span>, [it began] your last Sunday’s
letter, posted, I see, on Tuesday, has just arrived, and
both your mother and I are glad to learn that you are
well and getting on finely. You neglect to answer the
questions I asked in my last letter, but as you never do
answer my questions I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised.
I am pleased that you are doing so well at football, of
course, but would like sometimes to have you make
even passing mention of your studies. Your mother
has been suffering for several days with a slight cold,
but is considerably better to-day and—</p></div>

<p>“It’s on the next page,” interrupted Joe dolefully.
“Turn over.”</p>

<p>So I turned the page and read—“on top of the
furnace, and it’s a wonder she wasn’t burned.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” said Babe, looking up. “Joe’s mother?”</p>

<p>I chuckled, but Joe was too depressed to even
smile. “The cat,” he said. “Go on. It’s further
along. Where it begins ‘Now for our news.’”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now for our news [I went on]. Your Uncle Preston
has just bought him a new car and he called up
this morning and suggested that we might run over to
the School Saturday in time for the football game.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Seems to me it’s quite a ways to go, nigh eighty miles,
but your Uncle says we can do it in two hours and a
half, and your mother’s willing and so I guess you’re
likely to see us around one o’clock if Preston doesn’t
run us into a telegraph pole or something, like he did
his old car. We are aiming to get there in time to visit
with you a little before you go to play football. I hope
you will do your best Saturday, son, for your mother’s
been telling your Uncle and Aunt Em some pretty tall
yarns about your football playing, not knowing very
much about it, of course, and I guess they’ll be downright
disappointed if you don’t win that game. Anne
Walling was up to the house Sunday—</p></div>

<p>“That’s all,” groaned Joe, and reached for the
letter.</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “what’s the big idea? Why the
forlorn countenance? Don’t you want to see your
folks, or what?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Joe. “I mean yes, of course I do!
Only, don’t you see, you big boob, what a mess I’m
in? They’re expecting me to play, aren’t they?
And I won’t play, will I? How am I going to
explain it to them? Why, they think—”</p>

<p>Joe stopped.</p>

<p>“You’ve been lying to ’em,” grunted Babe.</p>

<p>“Honest, I haven’t Babe,” cried Joe. “I’ve never
told them a thing that wasn’t so, but—well, you
know how it is! A fellow’s folks are like that.
They just get it into their heads that he’s a wonder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and—and jump at conclusions. Of course, I did
say that I was on the team—”</p>

<p>“That was a whopper, wasn’t it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No! I <em>am</em> on the team. I’m one of the squad,
Gus. When you’re on the squad you’re on the team,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. Last month there were more
than eighty fellows on the squad, old son. Mean to
tell me that they were all on the team?”</p>

<p>“Different now,” growled Babe. “Only twenty-six.
The kid’s right, Gus. Shut up.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” went on Joe uncomfortably, “when I’d
write home about the games I’d sort of let them
think I—I had more to do with them than I had.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said I, “seeing that you’ve only played
in one, and then for about ten minutes!”</p>

<p>“Two,” said Joe, indignantly. “And I played all
through one quarter in the Glenwood game!”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it’s up to you to climb down, son,
and tell your folks you ain’t the glaring wonder
they think you are.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” agreed Joe, but he didn’t sound
like he meant it. “I thought of getting sick, so I
could go to the infirmary, but I guess it’s too late
to develop anything now. If I’d got this letter
yesterday——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be an ass,” advised Babe gruffly. “Spunk
up and tell ’em the truth. No disgrace. Lots of
fellows can’t play football. Look at Gus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Huh, you big elephant,” said I, “if I couldn’t
play the old game better than you ever dreamed of
playing it——”</p>

<p>“Gee, I hate to ’fess up,” groaned Joe. “I’ll look
such an ass, Babe!”</p>

<p>Babe looked across suspiciously, and grunted.
“Any one coming with your folks, kid?” he asked.</p>

<p>Joe nodded and reddened. “They’re bringing
along a girl I know.”</p>

<p>“Huh! So that’s it, eh? Thought you weren’t
telling the whole of it. The girl thinks you’re a
bloomin’ hero, of course. You’ve been filling her
up with yarns about how you were the whole team,
and how you won last year’s game with Munson
alone and unassisted, and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” begged Joe. “I never did! But
you know what girls are, Babe. Have a heart!”</p>

<p>Babe looked flattered, and positively simpered,
the big goof! You couldn’t get him within half a
block of a girl if you tried! He scowled and
pretended he didn’t know what I was laughing about,
and said: “Well, you might bandage a leg or an
arm, Joe, and make believe you’d busted it.”</p>

<p>But Joe shook his head. “They’d ask about it
and I’d have to lie,” he said virtuously. “I thought
of that, too. I’ve thought of about everything, I
guess, and nothing’s any good—except——”</p>

<p>He stopped and sort of choked. “’Cept what?”
asked Babe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well—” Joe hesitated, gulped and blurted it out
finally. “I was thinking that maybe, seeing that no
one cares much whether we beat Mills or not, I
was thinking that maybe if you fellows spoke to
Rusty he might let me play for a while!”</p>

<p>“You have some swell thinks,” said I.</p>

<p>Babe didn’t say anything for a moment. Just sat
there hunched up in his chair like a heathen idol.
Finally he said, sort of thoughtful: “Rusty won’t
be here Saturday.”</p>

<p>“You could speak to him to-morrow,” said Joe
eagerly.</p>

<p>Babe went on like he hadn’t heard him. “He
and Hop and Danny and Slim are going to Hawleyville
to see Munson play. Newt Lewis’ll be in
charge on the side line and Pete Swanson or Gus
here will be field captain, I guess. Of course, Rusty
will say what the line-up’s to be, but if one of the
fellows was taken out, say, after the first half, it
would be up to Newt to pick a sub. If I was you,
Joe, I’d wait until Saturday.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t believe Newt would put me in,”
objected Joe sadly. “There’s Hearn and Torrey—”</p>

<p>“Torrey’ll be playing in the first line-up, in
Hop’s place,” said Babe calmly. “There’ll be you
and Hearn and Jimmy Sawyer. Now if it happens
that Hop leaves Gus here temporary captain, and
Gus says a good word for you—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say,” I interrupted, “what do you think I am?
I’d like to help Joe out of his hole, of course, but
you know mighty well he can’t play half-back like
Bob Hearn! It’s all right to say that the Mills
game is unimportant, but you know pesky well we
want to win it, and Rusty wants us to. Besides,
Munson licked them ten to nothing two weeks
back, and we don’t want to do any worse than that,
do we? No, sir, you can count me out! I’ll stand
by my friends, Babe, but I’m not going to risk the
old ball game that way!”</p>

<p>“No one’s asking you to risk anything,” answered
Babe, yawning like he was going to swallow his
foot. “You know well enough we can put it all
over that Mills outfit. If we couldn’t we’d have a
swell chance to beat Munson! They’ve lost that good
full-back they had when Munson played ’em, Gus.”</p>

<p>“But the guy that’s playing the position now is
nearly as good,” I objected.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe it. He couldn’t be. Shut up and
let your betters talk. I guess we can pull it off, Joe.
Don’t you worry, kid. Just leave it to Gus and me.
Only, for the love of little limes, if you do get
in Saturday don’t mix your signals the way you did
yesterday in practice!”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” said Joe, earnest and grateful.
“Honest, fellows, if you’ll let me in for the second
half—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold on!” said Babe. “That’s a big order, kid.
I didn’t say anything about getting you in for a
whole half. Be reasonable!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but don’t you see, Babe, if I get in at the
start of the last half I can explain—I mean the
folks’ll think I’m being saved for the Munson game
the week after, but if I only play for a quarter, say,
they’ll get on to the whole gag!”</p>

<p>“Kid, you’re a wonder,” said Babe admiringly.
“All right, we’ll do the best we can. Mind you
keep this to yourself, though. No talking!”</p>

<p>Joe agreed and was so grateful and relieved that
he tried to make a speech from the doorway, but
Babe shut him up. Just as he was closing the door,
though, Babe called after him. “Say, Joe,” he asked,
“have you got a photograph of the dame?”</p>

<p>Joe said he hadn’t, and went on out.</p>

<small>GUS BILLINGS CONCLUDES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The Coach and Captain Hop MacLean and
Danny Lord, who was first-string quarterback,
and Slim Porter went off to Hawleyville
early Saturday morning to see Munson play
Kernwood and maybe get a line on her. Before he
went Rusty told me I was to captain the team that
afternoon.</p>

<p>“The manager will look after things off the field,
Gus,” he said, “and Thompson will play quarter.
He knows what plays to use, so you’d better let
him run things as much as possible. Munson will
have some scouts here and we can’t afford to show
our hand much. We’ll win if we can, but I’d rather
we took a licking than show too much of our game.
Do the best you can, Gus, and make your tackles
good.”</p>

<p>Joe’s folks arrived just after dinner in a shiny
new car. Babe and I saw them from our window.
That is, Babe saw them and I got a couple of peeks
over his shoulder. He’d been sitting at the window
for half an hour. The car stopped almost underneath
and he nearly fell out, rubbering. Joe had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
made me promise to meet them, and so I went down.
Babe wouldn’t, of course. You can’t steer him
against a girl to save your life. Well, I haven’t
much use for them either, but a chap’s got to be
courteous. Joe introduced me all around and we
set out to see the buildings, me walking with Aunt
Emily and the girl. She was a right pretty girl, but
sort of shy, and didn’t have much to say. Sort of
small-town, you know. Wore her hair old-fashioned
so you could see her ears plain. The aunt was a
pleasant old dame and she and I got on swimming.
Once she said:</p>

<p>“Joseph tells me that you play on the football
team, too, Mr. Billings,” and I said, “Yes’m, I get to
play now and then.” “Well,” she said, smiling
pleasantly, “we shall expect great things from you
both to-day.”</p>

<p>We steered them up to Joe’s room in Routledge
after a bit, and pretty soon Joe’s roommate, Hal
Norwin, came in and I beat it. Mr. Morris seemed
to think that Joe ought to go and get ready to play,
too, but I explained that he didn’t have to hurry
because he wouldn’t get in until the second half.
“You see,” I said, “we’re sort of saving him, Mr.
Morris. If anything happened to Joe to-day we’d
be in a pretty bad way next Saturday, wouldn’t we?”
Then I winked at Hal, who was looking sort of
surprised, and pulled my freight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>It didn’t take us long to find that Munson wasn’t
losing any tricks. Tom Meadows pointed out
three of her fellows in the visitors’ stand just before
the game started. “That biggest guy is Townsend,
their left guard, and—”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to tell me,” said I. “I’ve played
against him. And the little fellow in the striped
shirt is Quinn, the quarter, and the other goof is
Taylor, the only back that made any gains against
us last year. Well, I guess they won’t learn much
here to-day, Tom.”</p>

<p>We don’t charge for any of the games except
the big game with Munson, and so we usually draw
pretty fair-sized crowds. Warrensburg folks are
mighty keen for anything they don’t have to pay for.
So we had the stands pretty well filled that afternoon
by the time Mills kicked off, and the other
fellows had fetched along maybe a hundred and
fifty rooters who made an awful lot of noise when
young Thompson juggled the ball almost under our
goal and gave me heart failure for a moment. He
managed to hold on to it finally, though, and we
soon kicked out of there, and the old game settled
down to a see-saw that didn’t get either team anything
but hard knocks.</p>

<p>We weren’t looking for a very good game, even
with three of our first-string players out of the
line-up, for Mills wasn’t very heavy and had lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
more than half her games that year, but I’m here to
say that she sprung a surprise on us for fair that
afternoon. For one thing, she was so blamed quick
that she found us napping time and again; and she
had a new variation of a fake forward pass that
fooled us finely until we got on to it. By the time
we were hep to it she had thrown a full-sized scare
into us and worked the ball down into our twenty-five
yard line. But that was in the second quarter.
The first quarter didn’t show either team up much.
We both punted a good bit and tried the other fellow
out and looked for a lucky break that didn’t come. It
wasn’t until that second period began that Mills
got down to work and had us worried for a while.
She got two short runs away around our left end,
where Slim Porter’s absence was sorely felt, as
they say, and then pulled a lucky forward that made
it first down on our thirty-four. Then she stabbed at
Babe and lost a yard. Then that bean-pole of a
full-back of hers worked that fake forward for
the second time, and made it go for ten yards,
coming right through between me and Conly when
we weren’t looking for anything of the sort. I got
a nice wallop in the face in that play and had to call
for time and get patched up.</p>

<p>After that, Mills got a yard outside Means, who
was playing in Slim’s place at left tackle, and made
it first down on our twenty-five. I read the riot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
act then, though not being able to talk very well
on account of having one side of my mouth pasted
up with plaster, and we held her for two downs.
I guess she might have scored if she had tried a
field goal, but she was set on a touchdown and went
after it with a short heave over the center of the
line that Thompson couldn’t have missed if he had
tried. I felt a lot better after that, and in two plays
we had the old pigskin back near the middle of the
field. Then Pete Swanson gummed things up by
falling over his big feet and we had to punt. Just
before half-time we worked down to Mills’ twenty-seven
and after Brill had been stopped on a skin
tackle play Pete went back and tried a drop kick.
He missed the goal by not less than six yards, the
big Swede! That about ended the half, and when
we got over to the locker room in the gymnasium
we knew we’d been playing football! We were a
sore crowd, and Newt Lewis didn’t make us feel
any better by telling us how rotten we’d been. He
kept it up until Babe told him to shut up or he’d
bust him and I said “Hear! Hear!” out of one
side of my mouth. Everybody was sore at everybody
else. Thompson had the nerve to tell me I’d
interfered with his business of running the team
and I told him where he got off. Brill was mad
because Thompson hadn’t let him try that goal
instead of Pete Swanson, and Pete was sore because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
he had failed. I guess about the only fellows there
who weren’t nursing grouches were the subs who
hadn’t got in, and amongst them was Joe in nice
clean togs, looking anxious and making signs to
me and Babe.</p>

<p>Well, we’d fixed it all right for him before the
game. Babe was so blamed stubborn and insistent
that I had to agree to his frame-up in self-defense
and so I told Newt about Joe’s folks being there and
how he wanted to bask in the spot-light on account
of them and that girl and how it was my opinion
that he hadn’t ever been given a fair chance and was
every bit as good as Hearn or Sawyer. It seemed
that Rusty had instructed Newt to use all the subs
he could in the last half and so Newt didn’t put
up any holler about Joe. And when we went back
again there was our young hero at left half, in
place of Torrey, looking nervous but determined. I
could see his folks in the school stand, the girl in
a blue dress, and his Uncle Preston’s black mustaches
standing out six inches on each side of his
face.</p>

<p>We had six second- or third-string fellows in
our line-up when the third quarter began, and I was
plumb certain we had our work cut out for us if
we were going to win the old ball game. Mills came
back at us mighty savage after the kick-off and had
things her own way until we took a brace and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
her punt. We sort of got together then and worked
the ends and a long forward pass and made her
thirty-one. Then we got penalized for holding and
finally had to punt and Brill sent the ball over the
line. Play sort of see-sawed again for a while, with
Mills having slightly the better of the kicking game,
and then the first score came, and came unexpected.</p>

<p>Joe had been holding his end up pretty well,
partly because I’d tipped Thompson off to go light
on him, and he’d made a couple of yards for us once
or twice. Well, pretty soon Mills had to punt from
around her forty-five and Thompson went back up
the field, taking Joe with him. Torrey had been
taking punts and Joe had taken Torrey’s place and
so Thompson calls him back without thinking much
about it. The punt went sort of askew and landed
in the corner of the field. Joe didn’t judge it for
beans and it hit about on the fifteen yards and went
up again with him grabbing for it. He missed it
but got it near the five-yard line, and by that time
a red-headed end named Brennan was right on top
of him. I don’t know how Brennan got there so
quick but there he was. Of course, if Joe had
thought he’d have let the old ball alone, but he
didn’t. He grabbed it, juggled it a bit and froze on
to it just as this red-headed Mills right end came
up. Then he started to run. By that time there
was a mob on the scene and I couldn’t see just what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
happened. But when it was all over there was Joe
a yard behind our goal line with the ball still hugged
tight and Bert Naylor was putting a big white 2
on the score board where it said “Opponent.” Joe
had scored a safety!</p>

<p>I started to bust into the poor boob, but he looked
so unhappy I didn’t have the heart to say much.
I just told him he had probably lost the game for
us and a few things like that, and let it go. He
certainly did look sick over it.</p>

<p>The Mills rooters went crazy and howled like a
lot of red Indians and we went back to the job,
pretty well determined now to make the fur fly and
get a score. The quarter ended pretty soon after
Joe had scored for the enemy and we changed goals.
Newt threw in a couple more subs, the silly jay,
and I expected he’d sink Joe, but he didn’t. If we
could have opened up on those fresh Mills guys
and used a few of our scoring plays we could have
licked them quick enough, I guess, but Thompson
had his orders from Rusty not to show anything
and nothing I could say would move him. Just the
same, we got going pretty well in that last period
and ate our way down to the enemy’s nineteen yards
only to have a sub that Newt had stuck in for
Pete Swanson boot the game away by a perfectly
inexcusable fumble that Mills captured. Newt had
a brain storm then and sent Bentley in to take my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
place, and although I offered to punch him full of
holes if he didn’t get off the field and told him I was
captain the umpire butted in and I had to beat it.
So I saw the rest of the game from the bench, and
didn’t mind it much after Newt pulled Babe out
two plays later. Babe was so mad that I felt a
lot better.</p>

<p>Mills was just playing for time now, willing to
quit any moment seeing she was two points to the
good and had us beat if only the whistle would blow.
But there was still one kick left in the old team, even
if it was mostly subs by now, and when there was
something like four minutes left Thompson got
off a corking forward pass to left end that landed
the ball on Mills’ forty-two yards. Another attempt
at the same stunt grounded, and Brill, pretty near
the only first-string man left, snaked through for
four yards and made it third down on the thirty-eight.
The stands had sort of quieted down now
and I could hear Thompson’s signals plain. They
called for a cross-buck by right half, and when the
starting number came I saw Thompson grab the
ball, swing around half a turn and hold it forward.
Then everything went wrong. That idiot Joe Kenton
had got his signals twisted again! He beat
the other half to the ball by inches, grabbed it from
Thompson and shot through outside guard. I
guess there’s a special luck for fools, for Joe found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a hole as wide as the Mississippi River, and the first
thing I knew he was side-stepping one back, giving
the straight arm to another and twisting right
through the whole outfit!</p>

<p>Well, there’s no use making a long story any
longer. Joe had speed, if he didn’t know much
football. Baseball had taught him that; and it had
taught him to be quick on the getaway, too, and it
was quickness on the getaway that got him through
the Mills’ lines. After that the quarter was the
only thing between him and the goal. I guess there
wasn’t one of the Mills bunch that could have run
him down from behind. That quarter tried to get
Joe near the twenty-yard line, but it looked to me
like he was too certain, for Joe sort of skidded on
one foot, twisted his body and was off on the other
foot, and I don’t believe the quarter even touched
him. Two long-legged Mills guys chased him over
the line, squarely between the posts, but it wasn’t
until Joe was lying on the ball that they reached
him.</p>

<p>After the ball was brought out Brill tried to
make those six points into seven, but he missed the
goal worse than Pete Swanson had. No one cared
much for 6 to 2 was good enough, and after Mills
had kicked off again and we had piled into their line
a couple of times the game was over.</p>

<p>I happened to be in front of Routledge about half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
an hour later, when Joe’s folks were getting ready
to go home, and I could see that Joe had made an
awful hit with the whole bunch. Old man Morris
was as proud as anything, and so was Joe’s mother,
while that uncle of his, with his trick mustaches,
was so haughty that he bumped his head getting into
the car. I guess the girl was tickled, too, but you
couldn’t tell by her looks. Joe was mighty modest,
too, I’ll say that for him. You wouldn’t have
guessed he was a hero, just by looking at him. I
helped Aunty into the car, and she smiled and
thanked me and said, as she shook hands: “I think
you did just beautifully, Mr. Billings, but wasn’t
Joseph wonderful?”</p>

<p>“Wonderful,” I said without cracking a smile,
“isn’t the word for it!”</p>

<p>When Rusty got back and heard about the game
he looked sort of disgusted, and then he laughed and
finally he looked surprised. “Kenton?” he said,
frowning. “How come, Newt? We dropped
Kenton two weeks ago!”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t, Coach,” said Newt. “Maybe
you meant to, but you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“That so? Must have forgot it then. H-m.
Well, it looks like it was a fortunate thing I did
forget it, seeing Kenton was the only one of you
with enough pep to make a score!”</p>

<p>That evening we were talking it over in Number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
11, four or five of us. Joe didn’t show up, being
so modest, I suppose. Finally Newt said: “Well,
we can laugh all we want to, but we’ve got to hand
it to Joe Kenton for one thing. He’s the only fellow
I ever heard of who played in a football game, in
which both sides scored, and made all the points!”</p>

<p>When the Munson game was over, all but forty
seconds of it, and we had them beaten, 19 to 7,
Rusty beckoned Joe from the bench. “Kenton,”
he said, “I’m going to put you in so you can get
your letter. Go on in at right half, son, but—listen
here—no matter what happens <em>don’t you touch that
ball</em>!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>CAMP RESTHERE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Three boys descended from the afternoon
train, dragging after them duffle bags,
blanket rolls and bundles until, as the
four-car train took up its slow and seemingly painful
journey again, they were fairly surrounded.
The half dozen witnesses of the exciting event
surveyed the three arrivals silently, unblinkingly for
a space and then returned to the interrupted routines
of their lives, dispersing at various angles
across the snowy expanse that represented North
Pemberton’s principal business street. Leaving his
companions on guard Hal Norwin followed, directing
his steps toward a rambling white building with
blue doors and window frames bearing the faded
legend “Timkins’ Livery Stable.” The agent disappeared
into the station, closing the waiting room
door behind him with a most inhospitable-sounding
<em>bang</em>. Bert Madden yawned and then settled his
chin more snugly into the upturned collar of his
mackinaw.</p>

<p>“Nice lively sort of a dump,” he observed.</p>

<p>Joe Kenton smiled. “How far is it to the camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Bert?” he asked. The sudden jangling of sleigh
bells broke the silence and both boys turned toward
the stable. A man in an old bearskin coat was
leading a horse through the doorway and Hal was
holding up the shafts of a double sleigh.</p>

<p>“Eight miles, I think he said,” answered Bert.
“Gee, we’ll never get all this truck in that sleigh!”</p>

<p>But they did, and themselves and the driver as
well, and ten minutes later they were jingle-jangling
along the narrow road, the runners creaking on the
firm snow, leaving North Pemberton behind. The
old blankets and fur robes under which the boys
nestled were warm enough for a much colder day,
and the bags and bundles, piled about them, added
to the warmth. The sun was setting beyond Little
Rat and Big Rat Mountains, and the western sky
was aglow. Presently, climbing the slight grade
between Little Rat and Marble Mountains, they
crossed a rude bridge, under which a stream gurgled
beneath a canopy of ice.</p>

<p>“Is that Rat Brook?” asked Hal.</p>

<p>“Glover’s,” answered the driver. He pointed his
whip to the left. “Rat’s over there about a mile or
so. Glover’s comes out of it further along.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” assented Hal, his voice muffled by the
flap of his collar, “I remember now. Rat Brook
crossed the other road, the one toward Burton.”
The driver nodded, spoke to the horse and flicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
his whip harmlessly. “I should think,” pursued
Hal, “that the other road would be the shortest.”</p>

<p>“Yep, about a mile, but this road’s easier. Too
many hills that way. Only one on this road, and
that’s just behind us. Get ap, Judy!”</p>

<p>Coming around the northern shoulder of Little
Rat, they found the sunset gone and the long
purple shadows of evening stalking across the floor
of the little valley. Big Rat loomed beyond, wooded
and dark. Hal pointed westward. “Old Forge
Pond’s over there,” he said. The boys in the
back seat looked, but there was nothing to see save
a rather flat forest of new growth maples and oaks
and birches. Then, suddenly, as they turned on the
winding road, a streak of tarnished silver met their
gaze for an instant and was swiftly swallowed up
by the trees.</p>

<p>“That was Rat Brook,” Hal informed them. “If
we followed it we’d come out at the lower end of
the pond. It wouldn’t be more than three miles, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Bert, “I’m quite comfy as I am.
There’s only one thing troubling me, Hal. When
do we eat?”</p>

<p>“Just as soon as we can,” laughed Hal. “We’ll
get there in about three quarters of an hour, I
guess.” He looked to the driver for confirmation,
but the furwrapped figure failed to commit himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
“Then we’ll fix up a bit and Joe can start supper.”</p>

<p>“Me!” exclaimed Joe startledly. “Gee, Hal, I
can’t cook!”</p>

<p>Hal chuckled. “Well,” came from the front
seat, “you’ll be able to do all the cooking we’ll need
to-night, Joe. I guess some cold grub, with a
cup of hot tea, will answer.”</p>

<p>There was a faint groan of protest from Bert,
but Joe relaxed again, relieved. They came to a
corner and turned left on a broader and more
traveled road. “Turnpike,” announced the driver.
“Lineville about nine miles.” He flicked his whip
northward. Then, after awhile, the woods on their
left gave way to meadow and Hal shouted: “There
she is!” And there she was, indeed, “she” being a
curving, mile-long expanse of frozen lake, nestling
under the upreaching slope of Little Rat. Here
and there along the further shore small camps
nestled under snow-powdered pines or leafless hardwood,
four or five in all, deserted, every one. There
had been several snow-falls up here in the hills already—to-day
was the twenty-seventh of December—but
they had been light, and the surface of the
lake had been swept clean by the wind after each
flurry. The driver said he guessed there was a good
four inches of ice there, and the boys rejoiced.</p>

<p>“Great,” said Bert. “That’s more than enough
to skate on and we won’t have to cut through much
to fish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“You aimin’ to fish?” inquired the driver. There
was a tolerant note in his voice that caused Hal to
assume that he thought they’d be wasting their
time. But no, he guessed they’d catch some pickerel
if they were lucky. “I couldn’t ever see any fun in
freezin’ my feet that way, though,” he added.</p>

<p>“Well, it is rather cold weather,” laughed Hal,
“but if we build a good fire on shore it’s not so bad.”</p>

<p>The driver grunted doubtfully and the sleigh
swung from the turnpike into a narrow lane that
wound between pine and spruce. The branches
sometimes flicked their faces and spattered dry
snow about them. The lake came into sight again
close beside them, its darkening surface seeming
now like a great sheet of shimmering metal. Then
the jingling bells ceased and there, in a small clearing,
stood the camp, its modest bulk silhouetted
against the ice. A rustic sign overhung a little
path that led down to the cabin, and on it the word
RESTHERE was printed.</p>

<p>Followed a busy five minutes during which the
bags and rolls and packages were carried to the cabin
and the driver accepted his modest fee of three
dollars, promised faithfully to return for them four
days later and climbed back to his seat. There,
having pulled three of the robes about him and
gathered his reins in hand, he paused to cast a
dubious look about the twilit surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mean to stay here all alone?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Hal.</p>

<p>“H-m,” said the man. “Well, every fellow to
his taste. Too blamed lonesome to suit me, though.
Good evenin’. Get ap, Judy!”</p>

<p>The cabin was of boards and battens and weather
tight. There was one good-sized room for all
purposes save cooking. The kitchen—a kitchenette
Bert called it—was tacked on behind. It was just
big enough for the stove, the wood box, and the
cupboard and a wide shelf along one side that
served as a table. The cabin held everything they
needed for their four-day sojourn, save food, and
that they had brought along in generous quantities.
Cot beds, plenty of woolen blankets, kitchen utensils,
stoneware dishes, even reading matter in the shape
of magazines several months old awaited them.
There was a small fire place and, outside, a rampart
like pile of cordwood, chestnut, hickory and birch.
Hal viewed its snug comfort with a proud proprietory
air, while Bert, his hands in the pockets of
his capacious knickers, opined that it was “one swell
joint,” and Joe, who had never so much as seen a
camp before, was reduced to an almost awed
admiration.</p>

<p>They “made camp,” as Hal phrased it, and then
set about getting supper. There was a pump outside
the kitchen door, but it failed, of course, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
work, and Bert went off with a pail and a hatchet
to get water from the pond. Hal filled the wood
box beside the stove and piled fagots in the fireplace
while Joe tore the wrappings from the
groceries and set out the tea and bread and strawberry
jam and potted tongue and butter. Presently
the fire was crackling merrily in the stove, Bert
came back with the water, blowing on numbed
fingers, and Hal unearthed the can opener from the
knife box in the cupboard. A quarter of an hour
later they were seated around the table in the big
room with the hickory and birch logs snapping and
blazing beside them. Everything tasted better than
it had ever tasted before in any one’s recollection,
and Joe made two trips to the kitchen for more
bread. Dish washing fell to the lot of Bert, and
Hal wiped. Joe drew a canvas chair to the fire,
stretched out tired limbs and was nearly asleep when
the others finished. Bert wanted to put his skates
on and try the ice, and Hal after protesting that it
was too dark to have any fun, unenthusiastically
agreed to accompany him, but nothing came of it.
An early rising, a tiresome journey, the long drive
in the cold air and, now, the lulling warmth of the
fire were too much for them. Joe went to sleep and
snored frankly. Long before nine they were all in
bed and hard at it.</p>

<p>They were up before eight, which, used as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
all were to being called, coaxed and threatened into
wakefulness, was doing pretty well. Breakfast over
they donned skates and went out on the lake. It
was a gorgeous morning, with a blue sky and golden
sunlight. The air was cold but dry, and, while the
thermometer which Hal had hung out overnight
proclaimed the temperature to be eighteen above,
they seemed scarcely to need the heavy clothing they
had put on. Bert was an excellent skater, and Hal
was almost as good. Hal, indeed, had won several
prizes for speed skating. Bert’s inclination ran
more to fancy “stunts” and tricks, and this morning
he fairly outdid himself. Joe, a mere beginner and
a most unpromising one, moved diffidently about
and watched, at once admiring and envious. Presently
they set out together to follow the shore and
explore. It wasn’t long before Joe had fallen behind,
but he was fairly content with his progress
since, at least, he had managed to keep on his feet;
and that was something of a triumph for Joe! He
caught up with them when they stopped to climb
ashore and investigate the first of the neighboring
camps, and lost them again beyond the turn of the
lake. They shouted laughing encouragement to him
now and then, but they didn’t wait for him, and he
came on them next when they rested on the edge of
the little bridge that carried the pond road across the
mouth of Rat Brook. Old Forge Pond was fed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
springs and by dozens of trickling rills that wound
down from the encompassing hills, but it had only
one outlet, and that was Rat Brook. It, too, was
frozen solid on top, although by listening intently
they could hear the soft rippling and gurgling of
the water beneath. It was about twelve feet broad
at its widest and flowed off eastward between birch
and alder and witch-hazel to North Pemberton and,
eventually, the Chicontomoc River.</p>

<p>“It would be sort of fun to skate down the
brook,” suggested Bert. “How far could you go,
do you think?”</p>

<p>“Most to North Pemberton, I guess,” said Hal.
“There isn’t much fall to it. Maybe you’d have to
walk around here and there, though. We’ll try it
some time, eh?”</p>

<p>Joe wasn’t nearly rested when they started on,
but he dropped from the bridge heroically and went,
too, trying his best to copy Hal’s easy motions and
to keep his strokes long. He thought he was doing
pretty well, too, but pride goeth before a fall, and
suddenly the ice rose up and smote him heavily and
complacency was swiftly jarred out of him. The
others, well ahead, waved consoling hands, but
didn’t stop. They were used to seeing Joe tumble.
When he picked himself up he no longer tried to
emulate Hal, but continued in his own safer, if
less attractive style, reaching the camp some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
after the others, rather tired but suffering from no
further contusions.</p>

<p>They chopped holes through the ice a little later
and rigged their lines, not without difficulty. By
that time their thoughts turned toward food and
the fishing operations were postponed until afternoon.
Then, with a good fire burning on the shore,
they baited their hooks and sat down to watch the
tiny wisps of cloth, which, torn from an old red
tablecloth, shone bravely in the afternoon sunlight.
They sat there nearly an hour before any of the three
flags showed signs of life. Then Hal’s jerked upward
and Hal, scrambling to his feet, skated
swiftly toward it, so swiftly, in fact, that he over-skated
the hole. But he landed a fair-sized pickerel
and was proudly displaying the agitated fish when
Joe gave a shrill yell and went plunging, floundering,
arms waving, to where, further up the lake his
particular little red flag was threatening to follow
the line under the ice. The others, watching,
whooped with glee at Joe’s antics and roared when,
losing his balance at last, he crashed to the ice and
arrived at the hole on the seat of his knickers!
He, too, captured his trophy, which, on comparison,
was found to be a half inch longer than Hal’s,
although Hal did his utmost to stretch his pickerel
enough to offset the difference. At dusk they had
five fish. Hal had caught two, Joe had caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
two and Bert one. But Bert’s was so much larger
that there couldn’t be any discussion. It measured
just seventeen and five-eighths inches by the yard
stick. Bert was very insistent on the five-eighths!
Both he and Joe disclaimed any knowledge of the
gentle art of cleaning fish, and so that duty fell to
Hal. Supper that night was wonderful, for fried
pickerel—even if not dipped in crumbs, and these
weren’t—are delicious at any time and doubly so
when you have caught them yourself.</p>

<p class="cap">Another night of deep, restful sleep followed,
and in the morning they woke to
find that it had snowed a good two inches
already and was still at it. There was enough wind,
however, to clear the ice in places, and they went
skating again. A block of wood and three sticks
gave them an hour’s fun at shinny, during which
Joe fell down on an average of once a minute and
occasioned no end of amusement for his companions.
He limped noticeably while getting dinner
and, during that meal, paused frequently to place
a gentle inquiring hand on various surfaces. Later
they tried fishing again, the snow, now coming
down in larger flakes and in a more desultory
fashion, adding to the enjoyment. Perhaps the
pickerel disliked being out in a snowstorm, for the
boys sat around the fire a long while, talking and
listening to the hiss of the flakes against the embers,
without interruption until there came a faint hail
from across the lake and they descried dimly a
horse and sleigh outlined against the snowy bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
beyond the distant turnpike and the figure of a
man standing at the edge of the ice.</p>

<p>“Better go and see what he wants,” said Bert,
and they skated over. The man on the shore was a
big, burly, red-faced individual, in a rough brown
ulster and a peaked cloth cap. A second man remained
in the sleigh beyond.</p>

<p>“You boys been around here long?” asked the
man gruffly.</p>

<p>“Since day before yesterday,” replied Bert.
“We’re staying at Mr. Norwin’s camp over there in
the cove.”</p>

<p>The man rolled the remains of an unlighted cigar
between his lips while his eyes, small but very bright
and keen, ranged over the lads. Then: “Seen any
one else around here this morning?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir, not a soul,” Bert assured him.</p>

<p>The man’s gaze roamed across the lake and he
nodded toward the deserted cabins there. “Ain’t
seen any one around any of those camps?”</p>

<p>“No, they’re closed up tight. We were around
there yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t been around to-day, though, have you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not yet.”</p>

<p>The man nodded. “Guess I’d better take a look,”
he said more to himself than to them. “My name’s
Collins,” he added then. “I’m Sheriff down to
Pemberton. A couple of thugs walked into Robbins’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
hardware store at North Pemberton last
night about nine o’clock and got away with three
hundred and sixty-eight dollars in money and two
Liberty Bonds. Old man Robbins was working
on his books and had his safe open. They cracked
him over the head and almost did for the old fellow.”
To his hearers it seemed that Mr. Sheriff
Collins dwelt almost lovingly on the latter portion
of his narrative.</p>

<p>“That—that was too bad,” said Hal, rather
lamely.</p>

<p>Mr. Collins grunted. “Guess he’ll pull through,
though he’s pretty old to get bumped like he did.
Well, you fellows keep your eyes open and if you
see any suspicious characters around get in touch
with my office right away, understand. They might
show up here. You can’t tell. Last night’s snow
came along pretty lucky for ’em, covering up their
foot-prints like it did. Guess if it hadn’t been for the
snow I’d have caught ’em before this.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Bert, “we’ll keep a lookout. Only
I don’t just see,” he added dubiously, “how we
could let you know if we did see them. I don’t
suppose there’s any telephone around here, is there?”</p>

<p>The Sheriff pursed his lips and studied the stub of
cigar, which he removed for the purpose. “Guess
that’s so, too,” he acknowledged. “There’s a ’phone
at Old Forge, but that’s pretty nigh six miles. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
there’s one at Lincoln’s, up—no, there ain’t neither.
He had it taken out last summer ’cause the city
folks was always runnin’ in there to ring up Boston
or New York or some place and always forgettin’
to pay for it. Well, there’s telephones down to
North Pemberton, anyway, and—”</p>

<p>“How far would that be?” asked Bert innocently.</p>

<p>The Sheriff blinked. “’Bout eight or nine miles,
maybe, by road: ’bout six if you take the trail.”</p>

<p>Bert grinned. “I’m afraid the robbers would
get away before we reached the telephone,” he
said.</p>

<p>“That’s my lookout.” Sheriff Collins spoke
sternly. “It’s your duty as a citizen to let me know
just as soon as you can if those fellers turn up
around here, and, mind, I’m holdin’ you to it.” He
glared hard a moment, rolling his soggy fragment
of cigar in his mouth. Then he nodded, turned and
scrambled back up the slope to where the sleigh
awaited.</p>

<p>The boys skated back to the fire, replenished it
and discussed the exciting event. The sound of
sleigh bells coming ever nearer told them that
Sheriff Collins was following the road around the
lake to the empty cabins. Presently it passed behind
them and became fainter. Joe looked thoughtfully
along the curving shore. “You know,” he
said, “those robbers might be around. We don’t
know that they aren’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Bert sniffed. “Pshaw,” he said, “they wouldn’t
stay around here. They’d hike out for the city.”</p>

<p>Hal was thereupon prompted to tell just what
he would do to throw the bloodhounds of the Law
off his track in case he had committed a robbery,
and then Bert indulged in a few theories, and thus
a pleasant half hour passed, during which the
Sheriff’s sleigh jingled back and past and out of
hearing, presumably without the fugitives. Wearying
of the subject under discussion, Joe presently
arose and slid out on to the ice, where, thinking himself
unobserved, he attempted a figure eight and
promptly sat down. The resultant concussion was
sufficient to attract the attention of the others, and
Bert asked in a very disgusted voice:</p>

<p>“Gee, Joe, aren’t you <em>ever</em> going to learn to
skate?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” replied Joe dolefully.</p>

<p>“Well, you never will until you <em>do</em> believe it,”
said Hal decidedly. “You’ve got to have confidence,
Joe. Just—just forget yourself a minute, you
dumb-bell; forget that you’re skating and strike
out as though you wanted to get somewhere and
didn’t know you had skates on at all! Just—just
let your skates do it!”</p>

<p>That may have been excellent advice, but Joe
didn’t act on it. Discouragedly he returned to the
dying fire. Bert viewed him with disfavor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re scared,” he said. “That’s your main
trouble. You’re afraid you’ll fall.”</p>

<p>“So would you be if you were black-and-blue all
over,” replied Joe spiritedly. “I don’t mind falling
now and then; anyway, I ain’t afraid; but I don’t
like to fall all the time!”</p>

<p>Hal laughed. “Why don’t you try tying a
pillow behind you, Joe?”</p>

<p>Joe echoed the laugh, though faintly. “I guess
it would have to be a—what do you call it?—bolster!”</p>

<p>“We aren’t going to get any fish to-day,” said
Bert, “and I’m getting frozen. Let’s pull up the
lines and go in.” Hal agreed, and, when the lines
were up, he and Bert started toward camp. “Aren’t
you coming, Joe?” Hal called.</p>

<p>“Not just yet,” Joe replied. “I guess I’ll stay
out and—and fall down awhile!”</p>

<p>The others went on, laughing, leaving Joe the sole
occupant of the broad frozen surface. It had
stopped snowing now, and there was a hint of color
in the west that promised clearing. Joe started
warily down the lake, keeping near the shore where
the wind had freakishly swept the powdery snow
from the ice and arranged it in long windrows
whose shadowed hollows were purpling with the
twilight. It was, he reflected, all well enough for
Hal to tell him to have confidence, but—here Joe’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
arms described a windmill sweep in the air and he
narrowly escaped a tumble—how could you have
confidence when you just went off your feet every
time you tried to skate faster than a walk? There
was, though, a good deal of persistent courage in his
make-up, and he kept on, rather more confident
perhaps because he was safe from observation. He
rounded the turn and could see, far ahead, the little
bridge that spanned the outlet. As he floundered
on, awkwardly but with grim determination, he
passed the empty, shuttered cabins. They looked
lonesome and eerie in the gathering shadows, and
he recalled with a little nervous thrill the visit of
the Sheriff and his mission.</p>

<p>Back in the camp, Hal aroused the smouldering
fire in the chimney place and he and Bert, having
removed their damp mackinaws and damper boots,
drew chairs to the fire and sank luxuriously into
them. “Funny about Joe,” observed Bert, after a
silence. “You’d think a fellow as old as he is—sixteen,
isn’t he?—would have learned to skate
better.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Hal agreed. “He can do other
things though.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Bert, grinning. “Like cooking.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and—say, Bert, I wonder if we’re putting
it on him a bit. Making him do the cooking. Maybe
we ought to take turns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe he minds,” answered the other,
comfortably. “Besides, neither of us could do it,
I guess. There he comes now. Let’s hope he hasn’t
busted any of his arms or legs!”</p>

<p>But it wasn’t Joe who threw open the door and
entered. It was a stranger. And it was a second
stranger who entered on his heels and closed the door
behind him. They were an unattractive couple; one
small, wiry, smirking; the other thickset, dark-visaged
and scowling. They wore thick woolen
sweaters under their jackets, but their shoes were
thin and it wasn’t difficult to surmise that when they
continued their journey they would be more appropriately
clad for the weather, and at the expense
of the occupants of the camp. Neither of
the boys had a moment’s doubt as to the identity of
the visitors. The Sheriff’s story was too fresh in
their minds. It was Hal who found his voice first
and gave them a dubious “Hello!”</p>

<p>The men waived amenities, however, and the big
one spoke. “Say, kids, we’re hikin’ down to
Weston an’ we’re sort of up against it. Get me?
We ain’t had nothin’ to eat since mornin’ an’ we’re
fair perishin’. We seen the smoke an’ come over
to see could we get a snack.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, we can give you something to eat,”
answered Hal, a trifle tremulously, “but we haven’t
started supper yet. If you want to wait—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aw, where do you get that stuff?” interrupted
the smaller man, thrusting forward to the fire and
holding his hands to the warmth. “We ain’t society
folks, bo. We can eat any time!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Slim,” growled his companion. “Sure,
we’ll wait. Somethin’ hot’s what I’m cravin’, an’
not no cold hand-out.”</p>

<p>“Say, listen—” began the other, but he stopped
at a menacing scowl and only muttered, darting a
nervous look toward a window. Bert and Hal had
exchanged troubled glances that had in some manner
established the understanding that Hal was to do the
talking and Bert was to take his cue from him. Hal
pulled another chair to the hearth.</p>

<p>“Better get warm,” he suggested. “It—it’s sort
of cold, isn’t it?” He seated himself on Bert’s cot,
yielding his chair to the man called Slim.</p>

<p>“You said it,” agreed the bigger man almost
amiably, as the chair creaked under his weight.
“You guys live here all the time?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we’re just here for a few days. We’re
from Central City.”</p>

<p>“Huh, must be sort of lonely.”</p>

<p>Hal agreed that it was, sort of. He was doing
a good deal of thinking, a lot more than he was
accustomed to, was Hal; and he was ready for the
next question when it came.</p>

<p>“Guess you don’t have many visitors,” went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the man with assumed carelessness. “Bet you ain’t
seen a stranger, before us, for days.”</p>

<p>Hal laughed with a fine imitation of amusement.
“You lose, then. There was a man here just this
afternoon; two of them, in fact.” He heard the
smaller visitor draw his breath in sharply, but his
amused look didn’t waver from the other man’s
face. The latter narrowed his eyes suspiciously.</p>

<p>“That so? Two of ’em, eh? What did they
want?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Hal carelessly.
“Something about a robbery somewhere. Where’d
he say it was, Bert?”</p>

<p>“Pemberton, wasn’t it?” asked Bert uninterestedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it was. One of the men said he
was a sheriff. They didn’t stay long. Went around
the lake and came out again and drove off toward
Thompson.”</p>

<p>“Lookin’ for a robber, was he?” asked the big
man calmly. “Well, say, I hope he catches him.
There’s a heap too many yeggs round the country
nowadays. Ain’t that so, Slim?” Slim agreed
unenthusiastically that it was. Slim didn’t look,
however, as though he enjoyed the subject. He
sat on the edge of his chair and failed to share his
companion’s apparent comfort. “Thompson’s about
twelve miles, ain’t it?” continued the other idly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thirteen, I think,” replied Hal. “Gee, I
wouldn’t much care about chasing robbers this kind
of weather. Bet that sheriff won’t get back to
Pemberton before morning.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t that a shame?” commented the man.
“Say, I ain’t meanin’ to butt in, sonny, but what
about the eats? We got a fair ways to go yet.
Get me? Lineville’s our next stop.”</p>

<p>“I’ll start supper right off,” said Hal. “Must
be ’most time, anyway.” He raised his voice and
spoke with surprising heartiness. Had the man
been watching him just then, which he wasn’t,
having transferred his gaze momentarily to the
leaping flames, he might almost have thought that
Hal was trying to make his tones carry beyond the
further window on which his eyes were set. “I
don’t know how good it’ll be, though, for, you see,
the fellow that’s our regular cook has gone to
North Pemberton, and I guess he won’t be back yet
awhile. But I’ll do—”</p>

<p>“Eh?” exclaimed the big man startledly. “North
Pemberton? What’s he gone there for?”</p>

<p>“We get our groceries there,” answered Hal,
rising from the cot, stretching and moving aimlessly
toward the front of the cabin. “It’s about eight
miles, I guess, and he isn’t likely to get back for a
couple of hours.” Hal stopped at one of the two
windows and stared out. “Hope he don’t get lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
coming back. It’s as black as my pocket to-night.”</p>

<p>It was black, if one excepted the lake. That was
darkly gray, and the moving form close to the
nearer shore was momentarily visible ere it melted
into the shadows. Hal turned away from the
window. “Well,” he announced cheerfully, “guess
we might as well light up.”</p>

<p class="cap">As it happened, Joe had been coming back
along the shore when the two men had
emerged from the woods at the left of the
cabin. They had not, he was certain, seen him, for he
had instinctively swerved behind a clump of brush.
His instant suspicion had become certainty when,
watching, he had seen the strangers peer cautiously
about them before slinking hurriedly to the front
door. When they had entered, Joe stood for a long
minute, his thoughts racing. He visioned his friends
robbed and beaten, perhaps murdered. His first,
not unnatural, impulse, was toward flight, but it
was brief, and after that he set himself to find a
practical means of helping the others. Several more
minutes went by and the twilight deepened. At
last Joe approached the cabin, keeping to the
shadows. The windows were warmly lighted by
the flickering flames of the fire as he crept across
the porch toward the nearer one, and he could
hear the low murmur of voices; sometimes could
distinguish a word. His first hurried glance over
the sill brought a sigh of relief. The scene inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
was reassuringly different from what he had
feared to find. Yet he was sure that the elements
of tragedy were there, and he was striving desperately
to think of some plan to circumvent the
intruders when, looking again, he found Hal’s eyes
on his. Then came Hal’s voice, suddenly raised, in
the words: “I don’t know how good it’ll be, though,
for, you see, the fellow that’s our regular cook has
gone to North Pemberton, and I guess he won’t be
back yet awhile.”</p>

<p>An instant later Joe was tottering cautiously over
the frozen ground to the lake, his skates catching in
hidden roots or colliding with snow-covered snags.
Fortunately the distance was but a dozen rods, and
he covered it without misadventure. Then he was
skating along the deeper blackness of the margin,
slowly that the sound of the steel blades on the ice
might not be heard back at the cabin. And as he
skated he thought hard. From the little he had seen
and heard he had gathered a very correct idea of the
situation back there. The robbers, who had doubtless
been in hiding in the hills between North
Pemberton and the lake since last night, had arrived
at the cabin chilled and hungry. Doubtless they
had demanded food and Hal had agreed to cook
supper for them. Then he had happened to see
the face at the window and had sent his message.
“Hurry to North Pemberton and give the alarm,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
was the way Joe had construed it. “We’ll keep them
here as long as we can.”</p>

<p>And now, past the curving point of the land, Joe
set his thoughts on the far end of the lake and put
every bit of effort into his swaying body. Just
when the plan to follow Rat Brook on skates instead
of seeking road or trail came to him he could
not have told. It was there, suddenly, in his mind
the moment he reached the turn of the shore. He
no longer sought concealment nor smooth ice, but
headed as straight as his sense of direction pointed.
The farther shore leaped out at him from the darkness
suddenly and he had to check his speed to
duck under the little bridge. Then he was off again,
the ice-roofed brook stretching ahead of him plainly
discernible in the faint early radiance of the stars.
His skates seemed to awake hollow echoes, but the
ice was firm beneath its occasional crust or light
blanket of snow. Rat Brook had little current, so
little that it froze almost as soon as the lake, and
while the water moved sluggishly beneath the ice
it did not weaken it. There was a straight stretch,
like a canal, for nearly a quarter of a mile, and then
the brook turned to the right, following the base of
Little Rat Mountain, and after that curved continuously.
Often the forest closed in on both sides
and Joe must perforce trust to luck rather than to
vision, yet save once or twice he held his course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Branches slashed at him, and now and then a protruding
root or fallen tree strove to trip him. But
somehow, in some instinctive fashion, he passed
them all safely and without decreasing his speed.
Had he stopped thinking of his errand long enough
to consider that speed he would have been tremendously
surprised, for he was skating just about twice
as fast as he had ever skated in his life, and, moreover—which,
if Hal was right, was possibly the
reason for it—doing it without conscious thought!</p>

<p>The brook had been turning slowly to the right
for some minutes when, reaching a clear stretch,
Joe saw trouble ahead. The brook broadened
where a second stream entered and a blacker path
there told him that he was looking at open water.
He might stop, with difficulty, and veer into the
inhospitable arms of the trees and shrubs, or he
might keep on, trusting to luck to find ice along the
margin. He chose the latter. Then there was a
gurgling and murmuring of water in his ears, a
wide pool of moving water at his feet and the swift
realization that for at least three yards the ice was
gone from bank to bank!</p>

<p>He had frequently seen Bert leap over a fairly
high obstruction set on the surface of the ice, such as
a barrel or a low hurdle, and he had witnessed other
fellows make broad-jumps on skates, but how
these feats had been accomplished he had no very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
clear notion. Nor had he time to consider the
matter now, for almost as soon as he had sighted the
crisis he was up to it. His heart did a little somersault
about under his front collar button, as it
seemed, and then he had brought his gliding skates
together, had bent at the knees, had snapped his
body straight again and was flying through air.</p>

<p>He landed in darkness, yet on a solid surface.
His left foot, trailing, caught its skate point on the
edge of the ice and brought him to his knees, but,
by sweeping his arms wildly, he somehow kept his
balance and somehow got both feet beneath him
once more and again struck out. A moment later a
sudden sharp bend found him unprepared and he
had to spread his skates wide apart and throw his
body hard to the right, and even so he almost came
a cropper and only saved himself by a complete
spin that must have looked more surprising than
graceful. Yet that was the only time he really
slowed down from lake to town, the town that
scarcely a minute later shot its lights at him through
the trees. Even the bridge failed to halt him, for
there was headroom if one skated low, and after
that the trees, and even the bushes, were gone and
he was speeding through a flat meadow, with the
church and houses of North Pemberton standing
sharply against the winter sky ahead.</p>

<p>His journey by ice ended where a wagon bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
crossed the brook near where the town’s one illuminated
sign proclaimed “Telegraph and Telephone.”
He climbed the bridge abutment and floundered
across the roadway. In the telegraph office a girl
blinked startledly at the sound of his skates as he
waddled from door to counter.</p>

<p>“I want to get the Sheriff’s office in Pemberton,”
gasped Joe, his breath just about all gone now. “I—it’s
important!”</p>

<p>The girl came to life quickly. “Sheriff’s office?”
she asked briskly. “If you want the Sheriff he’s
here at the Hotel. One block to your left!” The
last sentence was in a higher voice, for Joe was
already clanking through the doorway.</p>

<p>Camp Resthere’s uninvited guests did full justice
to the meal that Hal finally set before them, the
more so, doubtless, because Hal had encountered
all sorts of difficulties and delays. One thing after
another had, it appeared, been mislaid, so that it
required both his and Bert’s most earnest efforts
to find it. At such times there were opportunities
for hurried conferences. Then Hal cut his finger
while slicing bread. At least, Bert spent fully ten
minutes bandaging it, although, strangely enough,
there was no scar in sight the next day. The
visitors, especially Slim, displayed more or less
impatience, but the fire was comforting, they were
fairly certain of a long respite from unwelcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
attentions on the part of Sheriff Collins and they
contented themselves with grumbling. In the end
even Hal’s resourcefulness in the matter of inventing
delays was exhausted and supper was served. It
was a good supper, as it should have been since
Hal had cooked up about everything in sight and
practically left the larder bare. But there was none
too much for the half-famished guests. They ate
fast and wolfishly of everything and displayed no
hesitation in asking for “seconds” or “thirds.” Yet,
instead of displeasing their hosts they did just the
opposite, and Hal beamed and urged them on in
most hospitable fashion. In fact, if Slim and his
partner had been less absorbed in the pleasant
operation of satisfying twelve-hour appetites they
might easily have become suspicious at Hal’s insistence.</p>

<p>The meal ended at last, however, by which time
Hal’s watch indicated ten minutes past six. It had
been twelve minutes before five when he had stood
at the window and seen that dark form speed away
down the lake. Of course, Sheriff Collins couldn’t
by any possibility reach the scene until well after
the robbers had gone on, but there was snow on the
ground now and it ought not to be hard to trail
them. There was no telling how long it would take
Joe to reach North Pemberton, but, with luck—</p>

<p>A low ejaculation from Bert, across the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
aroused him from his conjectures and he looked up
into the muzzle of a revolver in the hands of the
big man. He felt much relieved when the muzzle
turned to the right and covered the disturbed Bert
again. The big man was talking.</p>

<p>“Sorry to trouble a couple of decent guys like
you fellows,” said the spokesman in gruff apology,
“but Slim and me are a little short of the ready.
Get me? And we could do with a couple of coats,
too, and maybe a couple of pairs of shoes if you
happened to have any to fit. Don’t bother to move,
friends. Just sit easy and Slim’ll take up the contribution.
If you did happen to move you’d be
mighty sorry for it, believe me!”</p>

<p>There was such a grim tone in the last utterance
that neither Hal nor Bert doubted the truth of its
assertion. They remained absolutely motionless
while Slim’s fingers explored pockets and, afterwards,
rummaged bags and all likely places of concealment.
The net result was some eighteen dollars
in coin and three return tickets to Central City. Hal
hoped that the latter would be rejected, but not so.
The big fellow seemed very pleased with them.
Then there was a thorough examination of the boys’
wardrobes and Slim and his companion took a fancy
to some underwear, two pairs of shoes—though Hal
doubted they’d fit—Bert’s and Hal’s mackinaws and
four pair of woolen hose. Hal hoped that the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
would prolong their visit to change into their new
clothes, but they didn’t. They put the mackinaws
on, to be sure, but the rest of the plunder they took
with them, or started to. That they didn’t was only
because just at the moment they were ready to
depart the door opened most unexpectedly and a
burly, red-faced man who chewed an unlighted cigar
said pleasantly:</p>

<p>“Stick ’em up, and stick ’em up quick!”</p>

<p>It was somewhere about midnight that night
when Camp Resthere settled down to normalcy.
The three boys had then been in bed for more than
an hour, but that hour had been, like the several
hours preceding it, devoted to excited conversation.
Now, at last, the excitement had abated. They had
re-lived the whole experience, discussed and re-discussed
every incident. Bert had told his actions
and re-actions, Hal had explained in full detail his
every thought and intention and Joe had, more
briefly sketched his part in the successful affair.
For it certainly had been successful. The boys
had recovered their property, Sheriff Collins had in
his keeping the money and bonds stolen from the
now convalescent Mr. Robbins and the robbers
were doubtless by this time safely ensconced in the
Pemberton jail. There seemed absolutely nothing
left to discuss or explain, and silence had lasted for
quite four minutes when Hal broke it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, Joe,” he observed out of the warm darkness,
“you must have made quick time to North
Pemberton. How long did it take you, do you
think?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Joe. “It was eleven
minutes past five by the church clock when I went
into the hotel down there.”</p>

<p>“What? Why, you didn’t leave here until twelve
minutes of! That makes it—makes it—er—why,
that makes it twenty-three minutes! And it must
be all of five or six miles! Gee, Joe who told you
you couldn’t skate?”</p>

<p>“Maybe your watch and that clock aren’t alike,”
offered the somewhat sleepy voice of Bert. “How
many times did you fall down, Joe?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. Then Joe
answered in tones charged with incredulity and
wonder; “Not once!”</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Hal triumphantly. “What
did I tell you? Didn’t I say you could skate if you
didn’t—didn’t <em>try</em>?”</p>

<small>ALONZO JONES SPEAKS</small></h2>

<p class="cap">When they were back at school Joe proceeded
enthusiastically with his skating
education. Fortunately there was cold
weather from New Year’s Day on and plenty
of hard ice. Confidence begets confidence, and
Joe progressed, but he would never have thought of
trying for hockey if Hal hadn’t suggested it. Hal
was on the school team, and so was Bert Madden,
and although Bert was rather less insistent than
Hal, between them they finally persuaded Joe to try
for the position of goal tend with the second team.
Joe won the position after a bare fortnight of competition
with Mac Torrey. In February he ousted
Hendricks from in front of the first team’s cage,
for, although Joe was still far from a really good
skater, he could keep his feet under him remarkably
when defending goal, had an almost miraculous
ability to judge shots and stop them and could, and
did, fight like a wildcat when his net was assailed.
In the first game against Munson he did his share
toward keeping the score as low as it was, and,
although Holman’s returned to Warrensburg defeated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
it was generally acknowledged that Munson’s
14 points might well have been 20 had a less able
goal tend than Joe been on the job. And the final
Munson contest found Joe working even better
under more trying circumstances. Joe, though,
was not the real hero of that strange game. The
real hero was—but let Alonzo Jones speak.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To be quite frank, I was not pleased when, on
returning to Holman’s in September, I found that
faculty had put Pender in with me in Number 19
Puffer. Arthur Pugsby and I had arranged, as
we believed, for Pug to move down from 32, where
he wasn’t quite contented for the reason that the
fellow he roomed with, Pete Swanson, wasn’t at all
Pug’s sort. Swanson was absolutely all right, you
understand, but he and Pug had very little in common,
Swanson being rather a sporting chap and
Pug caring for the scholarly side of life. Pug and
I were extremely sympathetic, sharing many enthusiasms
in common, such as Shelley and Keats
and Walter Pater; also chess and anagrams. We
even had similar tastes in food and drink, both
being very fond of pastry and both preferring grape
nuts to chopped walnuts on our sundaes. So, of
course, we were both disappointed when we found
that our plan had fallen through, and that Pug had
to remain with an alien spirit like Swanson and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
that I was doomed to companionship with a
stranger, which, of course, Pender then was. But
life is filled with disappointments which, however,
may frequently be made less poignant by a cheerful
fortitude.</p>

<p>My new roommate’s full name was Lamar Scott
Pender, and he came from Maristown, Kentucky,
where he had been attending a small school called,
I believe, the Kentucky Academic Institute. I remember
his saying that they had but twenty-eight
pupils and thinking that its name was utterly disproportionate
to its importance. In age he was my
senior by a year, being sixteen and two months,
but Pug always maintained that I would impress
persons as being older than Pender. I suppose that
was because I had always viewed life rather more
seriously than most fellows do. I think that gives
one an appearance of being older than one really is,
don’t you? Pender was much of a gentleman, both
in looks and behavior. I had always supposed that
southern fellows were dark, but Pender wasn’t. He
had sort of chestnut colored hair and a rather fair
skin and blue eyes. He explained this by not being
born very far south, but I don’t believe he was
right about that. He had a taste for athletics, which
I had not, but he was not by any means the addict
that some fellows were; Swanson for instance. He
tried football that fall, but didn’t succeed very well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
being dropped from the second team about the last
of October. He took his rejection very cheerfully
and joined the cross-country squad, and, I believe,
did rather well in two or three runs that were held
before Christmas vacation.</p>

<p>He entered in my class, upper middle, but he had
to work pretty hard to keep up. He confessed that
Holman’s was quite a different school from the one
he had been attending. I think he would have made
better progress had he taken his studies more
seriously, but he had what might be called a frivolous
propensity and was always looking for fun.
We got on very well together after we had become
really acquainted, which was probably about the
middle of October. Until that time I think both
Pug and I sort of held him under observation, as
you might put it. Friendship is very sacred and one
should be careful in the awarding of it. I don’t
think that Pender realized that we were doubtful
about him. If he did he never let on. But he was
like that. I mean, he never looked very deeply
below the surface of things. He saw only the
apparent. Lots of times when Pug and I would go
off together without inviting him to come along he
seemed not to notice it at all, and acted just as if
he didn’t care. Even after we had accepted him he
never became really one of us. By that I mean that
our tastes and his were dissimilar and that he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
came to care for the finer things of life, like
Literature and the Fine Arts and Classical Music
and Philosophical Thought. He was always an outsider,
but Pug and I got so we were quite fond of
him, being sorry for him at the same time on account
of his limitations.</p>

<p>Others accepted him almost at once, but they
were the casual sort; fellows who went in for
athletics or sang on the Glee Club or just idled their
time away in the pursuit of pleasure. Both Pug
and I could see that Triangle and P. K. D. began
to rush him in November, and if you happen to
know those societies you’ll realize that Pender was
rather superficial. Neither of us would ever have
considered them. Although the fact is immaterial to
this narrative, Pender went into Triangle in February,
and as that was after the second hockey game
with Munson, and as P. K. D. generally got most of
the athletic heroes, there was some surprise. But
I am far in advance of my story, and will now
return to an evening soon after the first of December
and proceed in chronological order.</p>

<p>Pug and I were playing chess when Lamar came
in and, as was his lamentable habit, tossed his cap
on the table so that the snowflakes on it were
sprinkled all over the chessboard. I ought, perhaps,
to say that by this time he was almost always called
“Lamy”, but both Pug and I preferred to address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
him as Lamar. I remonstrated with him for his
carelessness and he laughed and said “Sorry,
Jonesy,” and fell into a chair. While my name is,
as I think I have neglected to state, Alonzo Jones,
I have always objected to being called “Jonesy”,
and I had told Lamar so frequently but without result.
“Jonesy,” he went on, “have you got any
skates?” I shook my head. “You, Pug?” he asked
next. Pug also shook his head, scowling at the
interruption, the game then being at an interesting
and critical stage. Lamar sighed and drummed
annoyingly on the table with his fingers. “Well,
you know, I’ve got to have a pair, you fellows, and
I’m stony broke. After Christmas—”</p>

<p>“Please desist,” I said. “We really can’t put our
minds on this when you’re talking.”</p>

<p>Lamar grinned and started to whistle softly.
After a minute Pug said: “You win, Lon. Care
to try another?” I was about to say yes when
Lamar jumped up and lifted the board from between
us and tossed it on my bed.</p>

<p>“You really mustn’t,” he said. “You fellows will
overwork your brains. Besides, I want to talk.”</p>

<p>Pug was quite sharp with him, but he didn’t
seem to mind. He began talking about hockey. It
seemed that there had been a call for hockey candidates
and he had decided to report the next day.
“Of course,” he explained, “there won’t be anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
but gymnasium work until after the holidays,
and I don’t suppose I can wear skates in the gym,
but just the same I’d feel a lot better if I had a pair
of the things. It might help me to get the atmosphere,
eh?”</p>

<p>I said I didn’t see the necessity, and asked him if
he had played much hockey.</p>

<p>“Hockey?” he laughed. “I don’t even know what
it’s like! All I do know is that you play it on ice,
wearing skates and waving a sort of golf club at a
ball.”</p>

<p>“Puck,” corrected Pug, still haughty.</p>

<p>“Come again?”</p>

<p>“I said ‘puck,’” replied Pug. “You don’t use a
ball, but a hard rubber disk called a ‘puck.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Much obliged, Pug. You whack it
through a sort of goal, eh?”</p>

<p>“Into a net, to be more exact. Do you skate
well?”</p>

<p>Lamar laughed again. “About the way a hen
swims,” he said.</p>

<p>“Then your chance of making the hockey team
will be small,” answered Pug, with a good deal of
satisfaction, I thought.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll learn skating. I’ve tried it once or
twice. I reckon it’s not so hard, eh?”</p>

<p>Pug smiled ironically. “Possibly it will come
easy—to you,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hope so. Anyway, I’m going to have a stab at
it. You don’t happen to know where I can borrow
some skates, then?”</p>

<p>We didn’t, and Lamar went on talking about
hockey until Pug gathered up the chessmen and
went off. When he had gone Lamar grinned at
me and said: “Corking chap, Pug. So sympathetic.”
Then he got his crook-handled umbrella
out of the closet and began pushing my glass paper
weight about the floor with it, making his feet go
as if he was skating, and upset the waste basket
and a chair and got the rug all rumpled up.</p>

<p>A couple of days later I asked him how he was
getting on with hockey, and he said. “Fine!” He
said the candidates hadn’t got the sticks yet; that
they were just doing calisthenics. After that he
reported progress every day, but we didn’t pay
much attention to him, because if we did he would
never stop, and neither Pug nor I was interested in
hockey. But afterwards I learned that Lamar used
to spend hours on the gymnasium floor, outside of
practice periods, shooting a puck at a couple of
Indian clubs set up to make a goal. There wasn’t
any ice before Christmas to speak of, and so the
rinks weren’t even flooded.</p>

<p>When Lamar came back after recess he brought
a fine pair of hockey skates which his uncle had
given him. I said it was funny that his uncle should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
have known that he wanted skates, but Lamar said
it wasn’t funny at all because he had written to him
a couple of weeks ahead and told him. I think it
was about the tenth of January before the weather
got cold enough to make skating possible, but after
that the ice stayed right along until the first week
in March. Several times Lamar wanted Pug and
me to go over to the rink and see practice, but we
thought it would be pretty cold work, standing
around there in the snow, and we didn’t go until,
along in February, there was a mild Saturday and a
lot of talk about a game between our team and Warwick
Academy. So Pug and I, deciding that some
outdoor exercise might be beneficial to us, went over
and looked on. We hadn’t intended remaining long,
for Pug is subject to colds and I am likely to have
chilblains if I stay outdoors much in winter, but
as it happened we stayed right through to the end.
I was quite surprised to discover that the game
could be so interesting, even exciting, from the
spectator’s viewpoint, and I fancy Pug was, too.
Lamar, who was sitting with a number of other
substitutes on a bench, wrapped in a blanket, saw us
and came across and explained some of the subtleties
of the game. I asked him if he was going to
play and he said no, not unless all the others were
killed.</p>

<p>Warwick didn’t do very well in the first period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
play, only scoring four points to Holman’s seven,
but in the next half the visiting team played harder
and before long had tied the score at eight all. Our
fellows seemed able to skate better than Warwick,
but the latter showed more accuracy in putting the
disk into the net. Toward the last of the contest
Pug and I got quite enthusiastic and frequently
joined our voices to the cheers that arose for the
Holman’s players. The game was very close at the
end, each side alternating in the advantage, and some
of the players on both sides played very roughly. It
was not at all uncommon to see one player upset
another, apparently by intention, and on more than
one occasion as many as three fellows would be lying
on the ice together. I marvelled that the referee did
not penalize such rough behavior, but on comparatively
few occasions did he mete out punishment.
When there was but a minute or so to play Warwick
shot two goals in succession and led, 15 to 13. Then
Madden, who was one of our best players, got the
puck away from the enemy behind their goal and
took it unaided the full length of the rink and sent
it between the feet of the fellow who was on guard
at the net. It seemed to me that Madden was
guilty of questionable tactics when he pretended to
pass the disk to MacLean just before he reached the
Warwick goal. That deceived the goal tender, I
judged, into shifting his position to the left and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
made Madden’s shot possible. Lamar, however,
declared later that that was part of the game. Anyway,
while it gave our side another tally, it did not
lead to winning the contest, and I could not help but
feeling, in spite of Lamar’s statement, that poetic
justice had been done. I pointed this out to Pug on
the way back to Puffer, but Pug was very disappointed
because Holman’s had not won the game,
and told me between sneezes that I was deficient in
patriotism. Pug had a very bad cold for several
days following his exposure and so we did not attend
another hockey game for almost a fortnight.</p>

<p>That Saturday night Lamar was very full of the
game and I was quite patient with him and allowed
him to talk about it as much as he liked. He told me
why our side had not won. It seemed that much of
the blame lay with the referee, who had never failed
to note transgressions of the rules by Holman’s
players but had invariably been blind to similar
lapses on the part of the enemy. It seemed, also,
that the referee had been far too strict in the matter
of “off-side.” Lamar explained to me what “off-side”
meant, but it was never very clear in my
mind. I asked him what game he expected to play
in and he shook his head and said glumly that he
guessed he’d never get in any of them.</p>

<p>“You see, Jonesy,” he went on, “the trouble with
me is that I’m no skater. Oh, I can keep on my feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and get over the ice after a fashion, but I’m not in
the same class with MacLean and Madden and
Norwin and half a dozen others. Those sharks can
speed up to ninety miles an hour, turn around on a
dime and stop like a .22 short hitting a dreadnaught.
I can shoot, Jonesy, if I do say it as shouldn’t.
Even MacLean says that. I can lift the old rubber
in from any angle. When it comes to skating,
though, I—well, I’m just not there.”</p>

<p>“With practice,” I began.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure, but where do I practice? The only ice
within four miles is the rink. Besides, what I need
is about three years of it! Down in Kentucky we
don’t have much good skating, and, anyway, there
isn’t any ice around where I live. I thought it was
easy, but it isn’t. I’d give—gee, I’d give anything
’most to be able to skate like Hop MacLean!”</p>

<p>“Still, if you can shoot the—the puck so well—”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t get me anything,” he answered
gloomily. “You can’t shoot unless you’re on the ice,
and they won’t let me on, except to practice. Hop
says that when they change the hockey rules so as to
let you play the puck sitting down or spinning on
your head I’ll be one of the finest players in captivity.
But, he says, until they do I’m not much use. If
he wasn’t such a corking chap he’d have dropped me
weeks ago. I reckon I could play goal, but that
fellow Kenton has that cinched.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Too bad,” I said, “but possibly next year—”</p>

<p>“Sure, but it’s this year I’m worrying about. I
got canned as a football player, I never could play
baseball, and so, if I don’t get my letter at hockey
I reckon I’m dished.”</p>

<p>“You did very well, I understand at cross-country
running,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Fair, for a new hand, but you don’t get your
letter that way. Of course, I may manage to get
on the track team as a distance runner, but I hate
to depend on it.”</p>

<p>“Possibly you are setting too great a store on
getting your letter,” I said. “Quite a few fellows
get through school without it, and I don’t believe
the fact prevents them from—”</p>

<p>“Bunk,” said Lamar. “You don’t get it, Jonesy.
It’s Uncle Lucius I’m worrying about.”</p>

<p>“Is he the uncle who gave you the skates?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s good for anything in the athletic
line. He’s nuts on sports of any kind. Hunts,
fishes, plays polo, rides to hounds. It was he who
sent me here, and he as much as told me that if I
didn’t make good this year I’d have to hustle for
myself next. And that means I couldn’t come back,
for dad can’t afford the price.”</p>

<p>“I must say,” I replied indignantly, “that your
Uncle Lucius has most peculiar ideas!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe, but he has ’em,” said Lamar grimly.
“And that’s why it means something to me to make
this hockey team. Or it did mean something: I
reckon I might as well quit hoping.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>ALONZO GOES ON</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">While I had never had any sympathy for
fellows who made a fetish of athletic
sports and competitions, I could not
help being concerned for Lamar. Of course it would
serve his eccentric uncle right to be disappointed,
but it did seem too bad to have Lamar miss his
senior year. Pug thought just as I did, and so,
taking an interest in Lamar’s case, I went over to the
rink on Tuesday to see the team practice. Pug
couldn’t go, on account of his cold, and he acted
rather haughty when I went away, leaving him with
his feet on the radiator and sneezing his head off.</p>

<p>I soon saw that Lamar hadn’t exaggerated much
when he had said that he was not a good skater.
They had a sort of game between the first team and
the substitutes, and Lamar held a position next in
front of Joe Kenton, who was the goal guardian—and
had a hard time of it. He could skate fairly
well, though most ungracefully, until some one got
in his way or collided with him. Then he either
fell down at once or staggered to the side of the
rink and fell over the barrier. On one occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
when he had got the puck, he started off with it
and was doing quite nicely until one of the other
side got in front of him. Lamar tried to dodge,
and I really felt sorry for him because all the fellows
on the ice and all those looking on began to laugh
at him like anything. You see, he lost control of
himself entirely and went spinning across the rink
on one skate, with the other pointing toward the
sky, his arms waving and a most horrified expression
on his face. He kept right on going until
he struck the barrier and then dived over it into the
snow, head first.</p>

<p>I will say, however, that when it came to returning
the puck down the rink he was extremely clever,
for he could do what very few of the others could
do; he could lift the puck off the ice with a peculiar
movement of his stick and send it quite a distance
and very swiftly through the air. I gathered from
remarks about me that a “lifted” puck was more
difficult to stop than one merely slid along on the
surface of the ice. But, of course, when the first
team players came down to the goal where Lamar
was he didn’t help very much. He generally charged
into the first player who arrived and they went down
together. I returned to Puffer before the game was
ended, convinced that Lamar would never get the
much coveted letter through playing hockey!</p>

<p>The next Saturday the team went to Munson to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
play Munson Academy, Holman’s chief athletic
rival, and was beaten by 14 goals to 11. Of course
Lamar didn’t play, although he was taken along. I
heard all about the game from him, and I gathered
that our team had been defeated because of poor
shooting. Holman’s it seemed, had “skated rings
around the other team” but had missed many more
goals than it had made. I believe, too, that the
referee had favored the enemy somewhat, and I
wondered why it was that the officials so frequently
erred in that particular. I mentioned the matter to
Lamar, but he only said “Humph!”</p>

<p>After that there were several other games, most
of which our team won. Pug and I saw all of them,
although on several occasions the weather was extremely
cold and I frequently suffered with chilblains
as a result of the exposure to the elements.
Lamar played in some of the contests, usually toward
the last and always when our side was safely in
the lead. He had improved quite a good deal, but
was still far from perfect. He fell down less
frequently and was even able to dodge about fairly
well without losing control of the puck. He also,
on several occasions, made some remarkably good
goals, sending the disk into the net at about the
height of the goal man’s knees, which seemed to
worry the latter a good deal. Then March arrived
and the weather moderated somewhat, and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
only the last Munson game remained to be played.
We played but two games with Munson, one at
Munson and one at Warrensburg, the team winning
most goals in the two contests becoming the victor.
It was hoped that, as Munson was but three goals
ahead now, and as our team would have some
slight advantage owing to playing on its own rink,
we could win the championship. Lamar was very
certain that we could win, and told Pug and me why
by the hour. Or he did when we allowed him to.
Lamar was almost hopeful of getting his letter,
after all, for MacLean, who was our captain, had
told him that if Holman’s “had the game on ice”
at the end he would put Lamar in for a few minutes.
I asked if they were thinking of playing the game
anywhere but on the ice, and Lamar explained that
the expression he had used signified having the
game safe. I told him I considered the expression
extremely misleading, but he paid no attention,
being very excited about the morrow’s game.</p>

<p>When we awoke the next day, though, it looked
as if there would be no game, for the weather had
grown very mild over night, the sun was shining
warmly and water was running or dripping everywhere.
Lamar gave one horrified look from the
window and, throwing a few clothes on, hastened to
the rink. When he returned he was much upset.
The ice, he said, was melting fast and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
already a film of water over it. The game was
scheduled for three o’clock, and if the ice kept on
melting there wouldn’t be any left by that time, and
without ice there could be no game, and if there
was no game—Lamar choked up and could get no
further. I really felt awfully sorry for him, even if
it was perfectly absurd to magnify a mere contest
of physical force and skill to such proportions.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the sun went under later and, while
it was still mild and muggy, it seemed that there
might possibly be enough ice left in the afternoon to
play on. I was very glad, for Lamar’s sake, and so
was Pug. Pug, I fear, had become somewhat
obsessed by hockey. I had found a blue paper-covered
book about the game under a pillow on his
window-seat one day, and while he declared that it
belonged to Swanson, I wasn’t fooled.</p>

<p>About noon MacLean and the others viewed the
rink and the manager got the Munson folks on the
wire and told them that the ice wasn’t fit to play on
and that if Munson wanted to postpone the game—but
Munson didn’t. They thought we were trying to
avoid playing it, probably, and said they’d be over
as planned and that they guessed a postponement
wouldn’t be wise, because the weather might get
worse instead of better. So the game was played,
and Pug and I went. We were rather late, because
Pug had mislaid one of his galoshes, but he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
it finally, under Swanson’s bed, and we got to the
rink to find that it was lined two and three deep
all around the boards. We found a place to squeeze
in behind the Holman’s bench, though, and by
stretching our necks we could see fairly well. We
were glad afterwards that we hadn’t got close to the
barrier, because every time a player swiped at the
puck or turned short on his skates he sent a shower
of slush and water over the nearer spectators.</p>

<p>There was a good half-inch of water over the
rink, and under the water the ice was pitted and
soft, especially near the barriers, and now and then
the sun would come out for a few minutes and make
things worse. No one except Pug and I wore a
coat, I think, and we soon wished we hadn’t. Of
course fast skating was impossible on a surface like
that, and the first period was only about half over
when the rink looked as if it had been flooded with
white corn meal and water. When one of the players
went down, which was far more frequently than
usual, he got up wet and dripping; and once when
the referee got a skate tangled with some one else’s
and slid about six yards in a sitting position, laughter
was spontaneous and hearty from both sides of
the rink.</p>

<p>Our fellows had already scored twice and Munson
once when Pug and I got there, and there wasn’t any
more scoring for quite some time. This was largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
because no one could shoot very well, having to
hunt for the puck in the slush first and then not
being able to knock it very far through the water.
Several times one side or the other got the puck
right in front of the other team’s goal, but usually
it got lost and the referee had to blow his whistle
and dig it out from somewhere. It was during one
of these confused scrambles that Munson scored her
second goal. It looked to Pug and me as if one of
the Munson fellows had slid the puck in with his
skate, and our goal man, Kenton, said so, too. But
the umpire behind the net waved his hand in the air
and said it was all right, and so that tied the score
at 2-all.</p>

<p>It was pretty exciting, and every one was playing
as hard as he knew how, and some one was always
tumbling down and water flew everywhere. There
were a good many penalties, too, and once there
were but nine players on the ice, instead of twelve.
They didn’t try to do much real skating toward the
last, but just ran about digging the points of their
skates into the soft ice. There was lots of enthusiasm
and cheering, and lots of laughing. Pug
was howling about all the time and dancing around
on my feet. I tried to restrain him, but he wouldn’t
pay much attention to me, declaring that I had been
shouting, too, which certainly was a misstatement.
When the period was almost over Munson had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
remarkable piece of luck, making two goals, one
right after the other, and the half ended with the
score in her favor, 4 to 2.</p>

<p>The players looked as if they had been in bathing,
and MacLean was dripping water even from the
end of his nose. Kenton was the wettest, of all,
though, and said he had bubbles in his ears. I heard
him explaining that the reason Munson had made
those two last goals was because his eyes were so
full of water he couldn’t see through them. During
the intermission MacLean and Madden and the
others were trying to figure out how they could
win that game in the next half. They had to make
five goals now to tie the score of the series and six to
win; always supposing they could keep Munson
from scoring, too! Norwin suggested getting a
puck made of cork so it would float, and MacLean
told him to shut his face or talk sense.</p>

<p>“What we need,” said the captain sort of bitterly,
“is a couple of guys who can shoot a goal once
in six tries!”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Norwin, “but I didn’t notice you
shooting many!”</p>

<p>MacLean gave him a haughty look, but he only
said: “No, I’m as rotten as you are, Hal. How
would it be if we played a five-man attack next half?
We’ve got to score somehow. If we can get the
puck up to their goal we might get it in. We can’t
do it on long shots, that’s sure!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>So they talked about that, and Pug and I, being
right behind them, couldn’t help hearing them. And
while they were still discussing the matter Pug
pulled my sleeve. “Say, Lon,” he said, “why don’t
they let Lamar play? He’s a good shot, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he can’t skate, you idiot,” I answered.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t need to. Nobody’s doing any
skating, Lon. They’re all just floundering around
on their points. I’ll bet that if they put Lamar in
to play—”</p>

<p>I didn’t hear any more, because just then I leaned
down and touched MacLean on the shoulder, and
when he looked up said: “Pardon me, but I
couldn’t help overhearing your conversation, and
I’d like very much to make a suggestion—”</p>

<p>“All right,” said MacLean, rather rudely, I
thought, “make all you want, kid, but don’t bother
me. I’ve got troubles of my own.”</p>

<p>But I persisted, in spite of his scowls, and when
he understood what I was driving at he acted quite
differently. Of course he made the absurd objection
that Lamar couldn’t skate well enough, but I pointed
out to him that Lamar could skate as well as any
of the players had been skating, and he recognized
the wisdom of the suggestion. I must say, however,
that he showed small appreciation, for he never even
said thank you, but turned right away and yelled
for Lamar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lamy,” he said, “can you shoot a few goals if
I put you in this half?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Lamar. “You let me in there, Hop,
and if I don’t make that goal tend of theirs think
he’s at the Battle of the Marne you won’t owe me
a cent!”</p>

<p>“I’ll owe you a swift kick, though,” growled
MacLean. “All right. You take Norwin’s place.
We’ll manage to feed the puck to you, I guess.
Do your best, Lamy. We’ve got to cop this somehow!”</p>

<p>They had sort of bailed out the rink with
brooms and snow shovels and buckets, and when
the second half began you could see the ice in most
places. Lamar was in Norwin’s place and Norwin
was playing in front of the goal. For two or three
minutes Munson kept the puck and tried four or
five shots before our fellows got it away from her.
None of the shots went very near our net, though.
After that MacLean got away and pushed the puck
up the rink, with the other forwards lined across
the ice and Lamar a few feet behind. MacLean
tried to pass to Madden, but a Munson fellow
hooked the disk away. Then Lamar bumped hard
into the Munson player and they both sat down and
slid, and Brill got the puck back and every one
yelled “<em>Shoot!</em> <em>Shoot!</em>” But Brill passed back to
Madden and Madden took the disk in closer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
about that time every one gathered around and
sticks pushed and whacked and I couldn’t see the
puck at all. The Munson goal man was dodging
back and forth, kicking his feet and whanging away
with his stick, and his eyes were fairly bulging out
of his head. And then, somehow, the puck got hit
back up the rink and no one saw it for an instant
except Lamar, who had got to his feet again.
Lamar dug the points of his skates and raced up
to it and, before any of the Munson fellows could
reach him, had got the blade of his stick under that
puck and made a quick motion with his wrists and
there was a streak of water through the air and the
umpire behind the goal shouted and threw his hand
up!</p>

<p>Well, Pug and I yelled like mad, and so did
every one else; every one, of course, except the fifty
or sixty Munson fellows who had come along with
their team. That made the score 6 to 5. Munson
got the puck from the center, but couldn’t keep it,
and after a minute Madden slid it across to Brill
and Brill started in with it. Then, when a Munson
fellow threatened him, pushed it behind him, and
that was Lamar’s chance. He was almost in the
middle of the rink, but he was alone, and before
any one could interfere he had picked that disk out
of the slush and sent it, knee high toward the
goal. Half a dozen fellows looked to be in the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and some of them tried hard to stop it, but it got by
them all and landed in the corner of the net, while
the goal man, who had tried to stop it, too, picked
himself up and patted the water from the seat of
his shorts.</p>

<p>Well, there wouldn’t be any use in trying to tell
about the rest of the game in detail. From 6-all
the score went to 8—6 in our favor, Lamar shooting
all the goals. Then, just for variety, MacLean
made one himself, though it looked pretty lucky to
me, and after that Munson made one. But that was
the last of her scoring. Lamar shot another from
near the barrier that hit the goal man’s stick and
bounced into the goal, and Munson lost heart. Of
course her players just stuck around Lamar to
keep him from shooting, but that didn’t work very
well, for he generally got away from them, or, if
he didn’t MacLean or one of the others shot. Toward
the last of it they just sort of massed themselves
in front of their goal and tried to hide it.
Even so, Lamar got a couple through, and several
more damaged the defenders considerably, one fellow
stopping the puck unintentionally with his chin.
It seemed that Lamar couldn’t miss, and, because
his shots were always off the ice, they were hard to
stop, and so, when the final whistle sounded, the
score was 18 to 7 and Lamar was credited with
nine of the eighteen! That gave us the series by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
eight points, and the championship, and there was a
lot more cheering, especially for Lamar, and Pug
and I went back to Puffer.</p>

<p>I felt quite a lot of satisfaction because my suggestion
to put Lamar into the game had, beyond
the shadow of a doubt, accomplished the victory
for our team, and I mentioned the fact to Pug.
Pug, though, was rather nasty, claiming that the
original idea had been his. However, I made short
work of that ridiculous contention, the more easily
since Pug, having yelled all through the contest and
got his feet wet in spite of his galoshes, wasn’t able
to speak above a whisper. I warned him that he
would have a sore throat to-morrow, but he scowled
at me.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” he said hoarsely. “I don’t care if
I do! We won the championship! And—and, by
golly, next year I’m going to play hockey myself!”</p>

<p>Which shows how even the briefest contact with
athletic affairs may corrupt one.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>GINGER BURKE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Hello!”</p>

<p>“Babe” Linder, the big catcher of the
Holman’s School nine, turned in the
operation of pulling on his huge mitt and observed
the speaker with mild interest. “Hello, son,” he returned
gravely. “Is it natural or did science achieve
that brilliant result?”</p>

<p>“What yer mean?” asked the other, earnest and
anxious.</p>

<p>“Your hair, son. How did you get it that way?”</p>

<p>“It’s always been red,” answered the smaller
youth, unoffended, but dropping his steady gaze a
moment while he dug in the dirt in front of the
bench with one scuffed shoe.</p>

<p>“You can’t beat Nature, can you?” sighed Babe.</p>

<p>The boy looked doubtful, but after a moment of
hesitation gave a nod of agreement. Three or
four other members of the team came around the
corner of the stand, followed by the coach, Gus
Cousins, and, subsequently, by Cicero Brutus Robinson,
pushing a wheelbarrow containing base sacks,
bat bag, protector, mask and the daily paraphernalia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of practice. Cicero, who was extremely black, very
squat and interestingly bandy-legged, deposited his
vehicle at the end of the bench and, wiping his
glittering ebony forehead with the sleeve of a faded
blue shirt, lifted the base sacks from the wheelbarrow
and ambled leisurely away with them. A
smallish, attenuated boy who had entered on
Cicero’s heels, dragged the bat bag forth and unstrapped
it. More players arrived, accompanied by
a studious looking senior in street attire who
clutched a large score-book in one hand and a box of
balls in the other. Babe Linder gave greetings to
the newcomers and, thudding the big mitten approvingly,
even affectionately, moved along the
bench. Unnoted by him, the red-haired youth kept
close beside him. Babe selected a discolored baseball
from among the dozen in the bottom of a fiber
bucket and—</p>

<p>“Say!”</p>

<p>Babe looked down. “Son,” he asked gently, “do
I owe you money, or what?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.” Two deep blue eyes looked appealingly
up from a tanned and freckled face. “Say, do you
want a bat boy?”</p>

<p>“A bat boy? No. I couldn’t use one.”</p>

<p>“I mean the team, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Why, we’ve got one, son. That’s he over
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yeah, I seen him.” There was much contempt
in the boy’s tone. “He ain’t no good, sir.”</p>

<p>“Eh? Well, confidentially, I agree with you, but
there he is, what?” Dave Cochran, dean of the
pitching staff, joined them and Babe addressed him
gravely. “This young gentleman, Davy, seeks a
position on the team.”</p>

<p>Dave studied the boy smilingly. “Well, we sure
do need a catcher,” he said. “Can you catch, kid?”</p>

<p>The boy nodded, digging his toe again. “Yeah,
but he’s just kiddin’, Mister. I want to be your
bat boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it? Well, you’re about a month late.
We already have young Cecil acting in that capacity.”</p>

<p>“Is that his name, honest?” inquired the boy
with what might be called hopeful disgust.</p>

<p>“No, not honest, but that’s what he’s called,” replied
Babe. “After all, what’s in a name? And,
speaking of names, son, what is yours?”</p>

<p>“Gi——” He swallowed and started fresh.
“Robert Burke.”</p>

<p>“Fine! And what do they call you?” asked
Dave.</p>

<p>“Ginger.” The boy smiled for the first time, a
smile that lighted up his homely countenance and
won both members of his audience instantly.</p>

<p>“Son,” said Babe, “if this was my outfit I’d engage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
you like a shot, but it isn’t. You see, we’ve
got a bat boy—”</p>

<p>“I can lick him easy,” remarked Ginger Burke
conversationally. Then he added, hopefully: “If
that guy wasn’t around could I have his job?”</p>

<p>Babe and Dave exchanged amused glances.
“Ginger,” said Babe, “we’d hate to have anything
happen to Cecil, but it’s my private hunch that—”
Babe coughed deprecatingly—“that if—er—Cecil
was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non est</i>, so to speak, your chance of filling his
shoes would be excellent. Am I right, Dave?”</p>

<p>Dave grinned as he reached for the ball that Babe
was juggling. “Them’s my sentiments, Mr. Linder.
Come on and let me warm up the old wing.”</p>

<p>With none challenging him, Ginger climbed into
the stand and became an interested observer of
what followed. Ever and anon his glance strayed
from Babe or Dave to the person of Cecil. That
Cecil was not the thin youth’s correct name bothered
Ginger not at all. He felt that it should have been
his name even if it wasn’t, and he disapproved of
it thoroughly, just as he disapproved of the bat boy’s
lack of interest in his professional duties and his
laggard movements when he retrieved a ball. “He’s
a dumb-bell,” was Ginger’s verdict. “He ain’t got
no license around here, that kid!” As a matter of
fact, Cecil was to all appearances quite as old as
Ginger, and fully as tall, even if, as happened, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
was built on a more niggardly style, and therefor
the use of the term “kid” by Ginger was unconscious
swank.</p>

<p>Afternoon practice ended at last and the field
emptied, the players walking back across the football
field and past the tennis courts to the big
gymnasium whose long windows were crimson in
the light of the sinking sun. To the gymnasium
also meandered Cicero Brutus Robinson, pushing
his wheelbarrow, and Coach Cousins and Manager
Naylor, the latter pair in earnest converse. Thither,
also, strolled the few students who had by ones and
twos joined Ginger Burke in the stand during the
progress of the afternoon’s proceedings. Of all
those at the field two alone turned townwards at the
last. These were Cecil—whose real name, by the
way, happened to be William James Conners—and
Ginger Burke. They did not go together. Indeed,
a full half block separated them on their journey to
Warrensburg, and to an observer it might have
appeared that that distance was being intentionally
maintained by the latter of the two, who was
Ginger. Observers, however, were few, for the
half mile between school campus and town was at
that hour practically deserted, and the few, their
thoughts doubtless fixed on the evening meal, paid
small heed to the two youths, nor guessed that the
first was cast in the rôle of Vanquished and the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in the rôle of Victor in an impending drama. At
the border of town Cecil turned to the left. So did
Ginger.</p>

<p>The next afternoon when Babe swung around
the corner of the stand, pulling on his mitten, and
turned toward the bucket of practice balls a voice
arrested him.</p>

<p>“Here y’are!”</p>

<p>Babe glimpsed something grayish arching toward
him and instinctively shot out his mitt. Such attention
on the part of Cecil was unprecedented, and
Babe gazed in mild astonishment. It was, however,
not Cecil but Ginger who met that gaze, Ginger
gravely earnest, anxious to anticipate the big catcher’s
next desire.</p>

<p>“Huh,” said Babe. “Where’s Cecil?”</p>

<p>“He ain’t coming,” replied Ginger. “He’s resigned.”</p>

<p>“Resigned, eh? Which hospital is he in, son?”</p>

<p>Ginger disregarded the question. “Who’s the
feller that hires the bat boys?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Son, are you laboring under the mistaken impression
that this job brings in real money?” asked
Babe.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I ain’t looking for any money, but it
seems like if the boss would say it was all right
for me to be—”</p>

<p>“I get you. Come along. Oh, Bert! Meet my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
particular friend, Ginger Burke, Bert. Ginger’s
the new bat boy. The former incumbent has been
forced to resign. Ill health, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t know that,” said Bert Naylor,
puzzled. “Well, it’s all right, I suppose. You say
you know this kid, Babe? Well—” The manager
observed Ginger sternly through his glasses. “We
don’t pay anything, you know. If you want to—to—if
you want the place, all right, but we—er—we
don’t pay anything.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re all right,” said Babe as Naylor
hurried off. “You’re official bat boy, son, with the
inestimable privilege of writing ‘B. B.’ after your
name. I would like to know, though, how you induced
Cecil to resign. Did you crown him with a
brick, or just—ah—” Babe delivered an imaginary
upper-cut against an imaginary adversary. But
Ginger only shook his head.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t no trouble,” he said evasively. “I—I
just talked to him.”</p>

<p>Babe viewed him doubtfully. “Well, all right,
son, if you prefer not to recall the sanguinary details.
On your job now. Watch the balls, see that
the water bucket’s filled, get your bats out—” Babe
stopped for the reason that a swift survey showed
the bats neatly arranged on the grass and the water
bucket brimming. “All right,” he ended flatly.
“Keep your eyes peeled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Ginger never confided about Cecil, but the story
reached Babe and the rest eventually by way of
Cicero Brutus Robinson, who, it appeared, had
learned it from the deposed Cecil. Ginger had
accosted Cecil a block short of the latter’s domicile
and had frankly informed him that he, Ginger,
coveted the position of bat boy for the school baseball
team. “You,” said Ginger, though possibly in
not these exact words, “are not equal to the demands
of such an exacting employment. It is evident to
me that your heart is not in your work. Now I’ll
tell you what I’ll do, kid. I’ll match you for it.”
Cecil, however, had indignantly declined this offer;
had, indeed, heaped derision on Ginger and his
ambition. Thereupon Ginger, retaining his placidity,
had made a second offer. “All right, kid, I’ll
pay you for it. I’ll give you fifty cents, twenty-five
cents right now and twenty-five cents next week.”
Cecil had considered this offer more tolerantly, but
had countered with a proposal of one dollar in lieu
of the sum named. Ginger had firmly refused to
pay a dollar and had so reached his third and final
proposition. “Nothing doin’,” Ginger had replied,
“but—” and one fancies a new enthusiasm in his
tones—“but I’ll fight you for it, kid!” Cecil had
regarded Ginger dubiously as the latter slipped out
of his jacket, had cast anxious glances up and down
the deserted, darkening street and had seen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
wise course. “Give me the quarter,” said Cecil.</p>

<p>As Official Bat Boy and Mascot of the Holman
School Baseball Team, Ginger made good right
from the start. He was, in fact, a revelation.
None of the players had before realized just how
useful a bat boy could really be when he set his
mind on it. Ginger was efficiency itself. The water
pail was always full, the paper drinking cups never
gave out, the balls no longer got lost merely by
falling outside the field, bats always reposed in
orderly precision before the bench and never a
player had to bend his august back to pick one up.
Ginger invariably knew which one—or two—each
batsman favored and was ready with it, or them, on
the second. He was always cheerful, always the
optimist, always hopeful to the last bitter moment
of defeat. When a hit meant a run and a run meant
a tied score or a victory Ginger believed, or professed
to, that the hit was forthcoming. Even if
it was the weakest batter, Ginger gave him his
favorite bat with a smile of confidence and a low
word of encouragement that seldom failed to help.</p>

<p>Ginger possessed, too, a remarkable acumen in
the matter of baseball practical and baseball theoretical,
and although he almost never volunteered advice,
his wisdom, the wisdom of an earnest student
of the game, was always on tap. When it came to
strategy Ginger was positively uncanny, having, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
seemed, acquired in his thirteen years of existence
a thorough understanding of the workings of the
human mind. You are not to suppose that the
games were run to Ginger’s directions, of course,
for, as a matter of fact, his advice was seldom called
for; yet during the six weeks that followed his
arrival there occurred more than one occasion when
Gus Cousins, watching a contest with Ginger beside
him on the bench, discussed affairs as man with
man and, unconsciously accepting Ginger’s ideas as
his own, acted on them.</p>

<p>It was to Babe Linder that Ginger especially attached
himself. He served every man on the squad
faithfully, liked them all and was liked in return,
but Babe was his hero, and where Babe was, there,
too, as near as might be, was Ginger. Ginger fairly
adopted the big catcher and guarded his welfare
with a care that was almost maternal. Babe never
had to strap on his leg-guards nowadays, for Ginger
was always waiting to perform that service. Then
Ginger handed him his protector and mask and
watched his progress to the plate with anxious
pride. When Babe came back to the bench there
was Ginger with his old sweater held out to him.
Of course all this aroused the other members to
laughter, and they ragged Babe about it; but they
were careful not to do it when Ginger was about.
Every one liked Ginger whole-heartedly, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
coach down to young Smithers, who sat day after
day on the bench and waited for something to happen
to “Mac” Torrey so that he might at last play right
field! After practice or a game Ginger would walk
worshipfully at Babe’s side back to Routledge Hall.
At the entrance it was always:</p>

<p>“Come on up, Ginger.”</p>

<p>“Naw, I guess not.”</p>

<p>“Well, night, son.”</p>

<p>“Night, Babe.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>ONE ALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Ginger called all and sundry by their first
names; all, that is, save Gus Cousins
and Manager Naylor. Gus was “Mister
Coach” and Naylor was just “Mister.” There was
no hint of disrespect in Ginger’s address, and the
word “sir” was seldom absent. It was on one of
those homeward walks after a Friday practice that
Babe learned about all there was to be learned of
his admirer. Ginger lived with his father, who
was a mason, in a two-room tenement. His mother
had died when he was a baby. There had been a
small sister once, but she, too, had died. Ginger
went to high school and didn’t mind studying—much.
When he grew up he was going to be a
baseball player until he had made enough money
to buy a team of his own. He had played ball since
he was seven, or maybe eight, on the back lots or
down by the railroad yards. He’d had a team of
his own last summer and had licked about every
other team of its age in the neighborhood. He
pitched sometimes, but generally he played second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
base or shortstop. Maybe he would get a nine
together again this summer, but he wanted to learn
all the baseball he could, which was why he had
sought the privilege of toiling without remuneration
for the school team. Once he had saved up
some money and gone to the city and seen a Big
League game, but it hadn’t been much of a game,
after all: “them fellows pulled a lot of bone-head
plays that day!”</p>

<p>To all appearances Ginger had attached himself
to a losing cause when he had thrown in his lot
with the Holman’s team. Since early April the
Light Green had won ten and lost seven; not a very
good performance for the nine whose two straight
over Munson Academy last spring had completed a
record of fourteen victories out of eighteen contests.
Holman’s though, had lost seriously by
graduation and only Dave, Babe, Captain Hal Norwin,
Joe Kenton and “Mac” Torrey remained of
those who had played against Munson. It was a
good fielding team, but batting was a lost art to it
and the pitching staff was a weak support. For
one of Holman’s four twirlers to go nine innings
was exceptional; usually it took three to land a
victory. Dave, a left-hander, was having tragic
lapses from his last year’s cunning. Bellows, slow-ball
artist, had yet to survive a seventh inning.
Jones, last year’s freshman southpaw, was streaky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and explosive. Meadows, more nerve than experience,
was as yet but a promising cub. Coach
Cousins, though, wasn’t discouraged, and still hoped
to capture the Munson series; and if the Light
Green triumphed over the Blue-and-Gold all that had
gone before was as nothing. To such a situation,
then, did Ginger Burke attach himself.</p>

<p>Two days after Ginger’s advent Holman’s was
beaten once more, this time by Milton. Then, the
following Wednesday, she faced the Benson
Athletics, a hard-hitting aggregation of mill employees.
Tom Meadows lasted an inning and a half,
after which Dave Cochran carried the game
through to a 4 to 2 victory. That victory seemed to
turn the tide for the Light Green. Holman’s
entered on a winning streak as startling as it was
gratifying. Bordentown, State Agricultural, Ogden
and Louisburg were defeated; after which Holman’s
journeyed to Wayne City and won a hard contest
from Deacon College. Three days later another
pilgrimage resulted less satisfactorily, for the
Light Green fell before the superior batting prowess
of Jamesville and her winning streak was broken.
But the next Wednesday found her on the long
end of a 9 to 3 score against St. John’s, which, since
St. John’s had beaten her badly earlier in the season,
was a gratifying and encouraging event. The next
game also went Holman’s way, although eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
innings were required to convince Townsend that
she was beaten.</p>

<p>It was during the Ogden game that Joe Kenton,
second baseman, awaiting his turn at bat, watched
Wentworth’s two-bagger go screeching over second
and observed to the bench at large: “There goes
their old ball game!” Then, when Charlie Prince
and Ted Purves had sped across the rubber, Joe
winked at Babe and addressed Ginger, squatting at
Babe’s feet.</p>

<p>“Ginger,” said Joe, “you sure brought us luck.
As a mascot I’ll say you’re a wonder!”</p>

<p>Ginger looked back over his shoulder gravely
and, after an infinitesimal pause, replied convincedly:
“You guys was sure needing a mascot when I
come!”</p>

<p>That was as close as any one ever got to making
Ginger claim the credit for the team’s success, but
they all had the conviction that modesty alone held
him back, and since baseball players, even school
amateurs, are all leavened with harmless superstition
there were plenty among them who would
listen to no argument against the mascot theory.
Babe said loudly and often that it was a great day
for the old school when Ginger came on the scene!
By this time the red-haired bat boy was a school
institution, in a manner of speaking. He was as
much a part of the team as—well, almost as much a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
part as Captain Hal Norwin himself. He had even
attained literary celebrity in the columns of the
school monthly. Holman’s had taken him for her
own and was proud of him; and rendered him the
respect due one who, even if you said it only in jest,
had put the school back on the baseball map. Ginger
now appeared appropriately attired at the games.
A discarded shirt of Babe’s, bearing a green H on
one breast, had been cut down to fit him, and from
Captain Hal had come the breeches. The latter, so
long as Ginger didn’t bend too far forward, were
quite presentable. Ginger also had a cap and a pair
of green stockings, and thus attired, feet widely
spread, arms akimbo, eyes attentively on the game,
he presented a notable appearance. And when,
thrusting back his cap—an action induced by excitement—he
revealed that unbelievably red thatch
of his the picture was almost epic!</p>

<p>June came on the scene with a fine run of blue
skies and hot sunshine, and the Holman’s team
went on winning ball games. Of course she lost
now and then. When you came to investigate matters
closely you wondered why she didn’t lose a lot
more. The pitchers were doing better, but not so
much better, the batting showed improvement but
was still well under last year’s percentage. Perhaps
Fortune was rooting for the Light Green, or perhaps
the team had found faith in itself. Certain it is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the breaks of the game went often to Holman’s
those days, and any one knows that it’s better to be
lucky than rich.</p>

<p>In the matter of batting, Holman’s was a weak
crowd. Outside Captain Hal Norwin and Ted
Purves and Joe Kenton, there wasn’t a dependable
hitter on the team. Sometimes Bud Thomas came
across with a needed wallop, and occasionally little
Charlie Prince, demon third baseman, laid down a
nice bunt. But for the rest—why, as Ginger phrased
it to himself, “junk!” They tried hard enough,
both at practice and in games, and they almost wore
out a brand-new batting net, but all to very little
purpose. If they had the eye they didn’t have the
swing, and vice versa. There was Babe, for
instance. Babe was a corking catcher, big enough
to block off a runner at the plate, quick enough to
cover the whole back-lot on fouls, an unerring shot
to second and steady under almost any provocation
to be otherwise. But at the bat he was Samson
shorn. Babe was a slugger, which is to say that he
took a long swing and a hard one and, having connected
with the ball, was likely to smash it out into
the cinder piles that intervened between the ball
field and Conyer’s Creek. The cinder piles meant
three bases always, usually four. But, like many
other sluggers, Babe was an infrequent hitter. If
pitchers would put the old pill between waist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and shoulder, Babe could show them something,
but pitchers had a deplorable way of sending them
over knee-high or working deceptive drops on the
big fellow, and, all in all, as a hitter in the pinches
Babe was about as much use as salt in a ham sandwich:
which, again, is Ginger’s phrase and not
mine.</p>

<p>This troubled Ginger as much, if not more, than it
did Babe. Ginger was a hero worshiper, and Babe
was his object of idolatry, and Ginger wanted him
100 per cent perfect. As it was, 75 was a lot nearer
the mark. And Ginger, or so he was fully persuaded,
knew wherein lay Babe’s weakness. Babe’s
bat was too heavy. Other aspiring batsmen might
use one bat to-day and another to-morrow, experimenting
in the effort to find the weapon best suited
to them. But not so Babe. Babe was big and long
of arm and powerful, and he craved a bat to match.
The one he used, his own private weapon, was a
veritable club of Hercules, long and stout and appallingly
heavy, of the “wagon-tongue” model, of a
dingy gray-black tinge and with the handle wrapped
far down with elastic tape. Babe was somewhat
obsessed on the subject of that bat. He was convinced
that it was the only weapon possible in his
case, and convinced that just as soon as Fortune
gave him an even break he would make it talk to the
extent of .300 or over. Ginger thought contrariwise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and the matter was the basis of frequent arguments
between the two. Or, perhaps, arguments is the
wrong word, for Babe never would argue about
it. Babe was as stubborn as a mule on the subject
of that bat.</p>

<p>“Honest, Babe,” Ginger would urge earnestly,
“that bat’s too heavy. It ain’t balanced, either. It
makes you swing late. That’s the trouble with you,
Babe. I’ve been watching and I know. You’re late
for the ball most always. Now if you had a lighter
bat—”</p>

<p>“Son, I’ve tried them, I tell you, and—”</p>

<p>“Two, three years ago!” scoffed Ginger. “Try
’em again, won’t you, please, sir? Honest I ain’t
kiddin’, Babe; I wish you would!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got to have something I can feel,
Ginger. Gosh, I don’t know there’s anything in my
hands when I pick up one of those toothpicks.”</p>

<p>“But I ain’t asking you to use one of them real
light ones, Babe! Just try one that’s a little lighter
first—”</p>

<p>Babe laughed good-naturedly and ruffled Ginger’s
flaming hair. “Quit your kidding, son, quit your
kidding. Watch the way the old bat soaks them to-morrow.”</p>

<p>And to-morrow Ginger, watching Babe’s humiliation,
almost wept!</p>

<p>Ginger never gave up the fight, though, and any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
one but the good-natured Babe would have wearied
of the importunities and become violent. Ginger
even besought the aid of Gus Cousins, but the coach
only sighed and shrugged.</p>

<p>“I know, kid. I’ve begged him to try something
different fifty times, but he’s so confounded stubborn
you might just as well talk to that water bucket.
He’s too good a catcher to be a good batter, anyway.
I guess even if he swung a lighter bat he’d still miss
most of ’em.”</p>

<p>The week before the first game of the series
with Munson, Holman’s had a slump and lost two
contests running. The infield, which had played
clean, snappy ball all spring, went bad and booted
half its chances. Medfield walked off with Saturday’s
game, 14 to 2, without making a hit that wasn’t
clearly scratch. Errors did the rest, errors and a
finally disgruntled pitcher. Monday and Tuesday
witnessed hard and unremitting practice, and on
Wednesday Holman’s journeyed down state to
Munson and crossed bats with the Blue-and-Gold
before a maniacal assemblage of students and
alumni, to say nothing of a brass band, and lost
deservedly. Bellows was knocked from the box in
the second inning, by which time Munson had
accumulated four runs, and Lou Jones took his
place. Lou wavered along to the sixth and then
began to issue passes. When he had handed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
his fourth in that inning, and Munson’s score was
5 runs, Dave Cochran replaced him. Dave held the
enemy safe for the rest of the way, but the damage
was already done. Holman’s had made a lone tally
in the fourth, and in the first of the ninth she started
a rally when, with one out, Tom Wentworth hit
safely for two bases. Joe Kenton laid down a bunt
and was safe on a close decision. Torrey hit to
shortstop and was safe on a fielder’s choice, Tom
going out at third. Bud Thomas hit an easy fly
to left that was misjudged and muffed, and, with
bases full, a hit good for two tallies and a home-run
tying the score, Babe advanced determinedly,
swinging his big black-handled club.</p>

<p>Ginger looked on strainedly, and I think he uttered
a little earnest prayer for Babe. But why prolong
the suspense? It was over after five pitched balls.
Babe watched one strike go past him and swung at
two more. You could hear his “<em>Ugh!</em>” on the
Holman’s bench as the force of his swing carried
him half around, but you couldn’t hear any soul-stirring
crash of bat against ball. Ginger groaned
and pulled his cap far over his eyes. Gus Cousins
shrugged. The Munson band blared and the Class
Day crowd took possession of the field.</p>

<p>Holman’s trailed back to Baldwin, a rather silent
crowd. Babe stared at his hands most of the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
unseeing of the sorrowing yet sympathetic and forgiving
regard of Ginger.</p>

<p>The next morning there was an hour’s batting
practice and a long fielding work-out, and at two
o’clock the rivals faced each other again. To-day
was Holman’s Class Day and her day for sound
and fury, but Holman’s had fewer rooters than the
larger school and could produce no band. To-day
Holman’s, cheered by her cohorts and on her own
field, got away to a good start. In the second
inning Ted Purves hit safely, stole second and
reached third on Tom Wentworth’s out. Joe Kenton
was passed. Mac Torrey drove a hot liner to second,
second baseman booted it and Ted scored. Bud
Thomas bunted toward the pitcher’s box and Cross,
Munson’s ace, after holding the runners, threw the
ball two yards wide of first. When the dust had
settled two more runs had crossed. Babe fouled
out to third baseman. Bellows drew a pass. Hal
Norwin, head of the list, tried two bunts and failed
and then hit the ball over third. Mac and Bud
romped home. Prince was thrown out at first and
Ted Purves fouled out to catcher. Five tallies
graced the score board.</p>

<p>Those five would have been sufficient, for George
Bellows held Munson scoreless to the fifth, when
two hits and a sacrifice fly netted one run, and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to the end, but in the seventh Holman’s added
two more tallies for good measure when, with
Torrey on second and two down, Babe made the old
bat speak at last. Cross had given way to Boyd, and
Boyd perhaps forgot Babe’s predilection for high
ones. That as may have been, Babe connected with
a shoulder-high delivery just over the edge of the
plate and sent it screaming to the very edge of Conyer’s
Creek, and romped around the bases unchallenged.
When he turned, grinning, toward the bench,
there was the dignified Ginger standing on his head,
his brilliant locks mingling with the dust of the
trampled field.</p>

<p>Later, said Babe: “Well, how about the old cudgel
now, son?”</p>

<p>Ginger shook his head and spoke sadly. “Babe,
that guy didn’t ought to have pitched you a high one.
That was a James H. Dandy of a hit, all right, all
right, but it don’t prove nothing, Babe, nothing at
all.”</p>

<p>Babe laughed and rumpled Ginger’s dusty hair.
“Son,” he said, “you’re just plain stubborn!”</p>

<small>THE DECIDING GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That was Thursday. The deciding game
was to be played in the city on Saturday.
The Holman’s team returned to the well-nigh
empty campus and settled down for the wait.
Gus didn’t make the mistake of working them hard
on Friday. There was a little batting and a little
throwing and a long talk under the shade of the
stand; and, of course, the pitchers worked their
sweaters off; but there was nothing strenuous that
day. One just sat around and waited—and hoped.</p>

<p>Late that Friday afternoon Ginger was an unobtrusive
unit in a group of five who lolled on the
campus sward where a big elm cast an oasis of
shade in a sun-smitten Sahara. It was very hot
and very still, and the deserted dormitories seemed
to have dropped asleep for the summer. Conversation
had been desultory, but all of the morrow’s
game. Now Captain Hal said smilingly, but with an
undertone of earnestness: “Babe, it’s too bad you
didn’t save that homer for to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“There’s another where that came from,” replied
Babe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not a chance,” said Dave. “They’ll walk you
every time you come up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” answered Babe. “You see, I
haven’t been hitting much, and they’ll think that
was just an accident.”</p>

<p>“Brainy guys, then,” murmured Dave, pillowing
his head more comfortably on one of Babe’s ample
legs.</p>

<p>“Is that so, fresh?” Babe pressed the heel of a
big hand sternly on Dave’s classic nose and elicited a
groan of protest. “If they’ll put the old pill where
I can reach it, Dave, it’s going to travel.”</p>

<p>“Sure, all you want is a straight one across your
chest. That’s not much to ask, eh? Seems like they
might do you a slight favor like that, what? Then,
if it happens you can swing that old bridge timber
of yours around in time, you’ll maybe get a hit!”</p>

<p>“‘Bridge timber!’” chuckled Hal. “That’s a new
one!” Ginger, sitting slightly apart, grinned. Babe
grinned, too.</p>

<p>“The old bridge timber did the trick yesterday,
just the same.” Then he laughed reflectively.
“Ginger was all broke up over that. He’s been after
me to use one of those toothpicks, like the rest of
you, and when he saw that homer he just dug his
face in the dust.”</p>

<p>“Ginger’s dead right,” said Joe Kenton. “You’d
hit three times as often if you used a light bat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Dave.</p>

<p>“Do you fellows think so, too?” demanded Ginger
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Joe. “You’ve got the right
dope, Ginger.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so,” said Dave. “If Babe didn’t have a
solid concrete dome, he’d know it, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t tell, I guess,” murmured Ginger.
It was one thing for him to criticize the ways of his
hero, and quite another thing to listen to some one
else doing it!</p>

<p>“Keep your orbs on your Uncle Babe to-morrow,
Ginger,” laughed the big fellow. “I’m going to
show you unbelievers just what the old bat can do.”</p>

<p>“I—I hope you will,” muttered Ginger. “I’d like
to see it.”</p>

<p>“You will,” answered Babe confidently. “You
sure will, son, you sure will. To-morrow about this
time you’ll be apologizing to me and the old bat for
all the harsh words you’ve spoken, Ginger. Sack
cloth and ashes for you to-morrow, son!”</p>

<p>“I wished I was going to be there,” said Ginger
longingly. “It’ll be the first game I’ve missed since
I took hold.”</p>

<p>“Mean to say you’re not going along?” demanded
Hal, while the rest stared in surprise.</p>

<p>“Can’t, Cap.” Ginger shook his red head regretfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Babe. “Who says so?”</p>

<p>“Mister Naylor. He says he can’t afford to pay
my fare. Course, I’d pay my own fare, only my—my
dividends ain’t been comin’ in very regular
lately—”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be blowed!” ejaculated Dave. “The
old miser! Going to do us out of our mascot for a
paltry five or six dollars! What’s it cost to get down
there and back, Hal?”</p>

<p>“Five—something. You can’t blame Bert much,
though. We haven’t begun to make expenses this
spring, and Bert’s the guy that’s got to make the
alibis. Still, it wouldn’t hurt much to loosen up on
a fiver.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say it wouldn’t,” declared Joe. “Look here,
you know, you chaps, we’ve got to have Ginger!
Gee, we’d get licked as sure as shooting without our
mascot! Let’s dig!”</p>

<p>“Keep your hands out of your pockets, you guys,”
directed Babe. “Ginger and I are pals, and I look
after his finances. You be at the train promptly
at nine-eighteen, son, and bring your rabbit’s foot
along. Something tells me we’re going to need it.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got any rabbit’s foot,” muttered Ginger,
flushed, joyous, embarrassed, “but I—I got a lucky
dime.”</p>

<p>“Bring it, kid, bring it!” begged Dave.</p>

<p>The league grounds in the city were neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
territory, without a doubt; and they were also very
nearly deserted territory when the game started the
next day. There was a small and devoted clump of
Holman’s supporters back of third base and a
scarcely larger company of Munson cohorts back of
first. And there were some six hundred representatives
of the general public scattered hither and yon
about the rambling stands. It was not an inspiring
scene. There was no band, there was but little cheering,
there were few pennants. The general public
munched peanuts and, still neutral, lolled in its
seat and yawned throughout four dismal innings.
It seemed that the teams were as depressed and indifferent
as the bulk of the spectators. The afternoon
was scorchingly, breathlessly hot, and to move from
bench to plate started perspiration from every pore.</p>

<p>On the toss-up Holman’s had won the slight
advantage of last innings, and so Munson went to
bat first. Dave, starting for the Light Green, held
the enemy hitless until the second and scoreless until
the fourth. He didn’t have much trouble doing it,
either, for Munson was listless and without ambition.
For the Blue-and-Gold, Nelson, a left-hander
also, went to the mound. Cross, Munson’s best
twirler, had worked in both previous games, whereas
Dave had not worked since Wednesday, and some
advantage was believed to accrue to Holman’s from
those circumstances. And yet, if Munson failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
hit Dave, so Holman’s as lamentably failed to punish
the Blue-and-Gold’s substitute twirler. Nelson
traveled scathless to the last of the fourth, but one
pass and a scratch hit being scored against him. It
was that fourth inning that captured the somnolent
gaze of the spectators and interrupted the steady
crunching of peanuts.</p>

<p>Munson’s first man up fanned, but the next ambitiously
reached for a wide one of Dave’s, got it on
the end of his bat and sent it arching into right
field, four inches inside the foul line and out of reach
of either Tom or Mac. Encouraged, the next batsman
hit straight down the second base alley, and
suddenly there were men on first and third and but
one out! The neutrals in the stands began to take
sides, and, naturally, rooted for the team that had
started going and was promising to give them something
for their money. The old ball park woke up
from its slumbers and comparative animation
reigned. Also, there was much noise from the
Munson section and the Munson coachers and the
Munson bench. Dave cinched his belt a notch and
woke up, too. But the next batsman was a good
waiter and nothing Dave pitched suited the umpire
behind the plate. Most unexpectedly, as things
happen in baseball, the three bases were occupied!
Moreover, the earnest-faced chap now facing Dave
was Munson’s clean-up man!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>To pass him, mused Babe, would force in a run
and still leave but one out. On the other hand, if
he hit safely two tallies would come across; maybe
more. He must, therefore, be induced to knock out
a fly, even if it was a long one. In response to
Babe’s signals Dave kept them low. The first offering
was a strike. The next two were balls. The
fourth delivery was fouled into the first base stand.
The next was a hair-breadth too low and made the
tally 2 and 3. Dave had to pitch it over now, but
with luck he could still work the batsman for an out.
And he did, for the long fly arched down into
Purves’ waiting hands. The man on third raced
home after the catch and beat the ball to the plate
by yards. But there were two gone now and Holman’s
breathed easier. To the next man Dave issued
the first pass and again the bases were filled. But
that ended the drama, for the Munson second baseman
went out, Norwin to Wentworth.</p>

<p>Holman’s went after that one run lead in her
half of the fourth and evened the score. Ted Purves
flied out to center, Wentworth reached first on shortstop’s
error, Joe Kenton sacrificed with a slow bunt
along first base line and, with Tom on second, Mac
slammed out a two-bagger into center. But that one
tally was all that could be had, for Bud Thomas’
liner went smack into shortstop’s glove.</p>

<p>Dave got through the fifth without much trouble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
only four men facing him. Nelson wobbled a bit
more, but also escaped injury, Babe fanning for the
second time, Dave flying out to first and Hal Norwin
knocking a weak grounder to Nelson. In the
sixth inning both pitchers became unsteady and only
sharp fielding saved them. In the seventh Dave
steadied down and fanned the first two aspirants.
Then came a double over second base and the
Munson supporters yelled hopefully. But the next
man perished on a foul to Babe. The last half of the
seventh witnessed the retirement of Nelson, warmly
applauded by both sides, after he had been hit for a
double and had passed two men. Cross, with but
one down, made Dave send up a pop fly to second
baseman and then crawled out of a tight hole when
Captain Norwin’s grounder was handled perfectly
by third baseman and Mac was nailed at the plate.</p>

<p>Dave was threatened with disaster in the first of
the eighth when, having hit the first of the enemy
and sent him, nursing his elbow, to first, he passed
the next opponent. A clever bunt filled the bags and
things looked black for the Light Green. The succeeding
play, however, resulted in an out at the
plate, and then a speedy double, Norwin to Kenton
to Wentworth, pulled the fat out of the fire. In the
last of that inning Captain Hal, Ted Purves and
Tom Wentworth went out in order, Hal third baseman
to first, and the others on strikes. And, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
1 to 1, the deciding game went into the final inning.</p>

<p>Dave pitched real ball in that inning. Munson
tried all she knew how to break through. With one
down, a victim to Dave’s puzzling delivery, the
Munson third baseman succeeded in dropping a
Texas Leaguer behind Tom Wentworth. A minute
later Babe’s hurried peg to second went just too
wide to nip a steal. A pinch hitter took a hand then
for the Blue-and-Gold, swung at a deceptive drop,
knocked a foul back of third, slanted two more into
the stand, let two balls pass him and at last hit safely
to short left. Then, with two on, Fortune favored
the Light Green. The Munson catcher landed
against Dave’s first delivery—he had tried to sneak
over a straight, fast one—and sent it smashing
across the infield, rising as it went. The runners
dashed away. Joe Kenton hurled himself high into
the air and to the right, shot up a hand and speared
the ball. Only the fact that when he came down he
landed, or so it appeared, directly on the back of his
neck, deprived him of a double play. By the time he
had recovered himself and shot the ball to third base
the runner there was safe. But there were two gone,
now, and Holman’s set herself desperately to ward
off defeat. The runner on third, instigated by a
coach with a voice like a load of furniture falling
downstairs, cut wierd didoes on the base path, kicking
up the dust, starting at top speed for the plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
only to twirl and scuttle back to the bag, dancing and
gyrating. None of these antics appeared to affect
Dave, however. He observed the dervish-like enemy
tolerantly and calmly and pitched to the batter, working
slowly and carefully, digesting Babe’s signals for
a long moment before each wind-up. He tried a
slow one that settled slowly toward the dust as it
crossed the plate and was adjudged a ball. He shot
a high one across the outer corner and netted a
strike. He followed with a curve, waist-high, and
heard it called a ball. Babe rewarded the umpire
with a look of amazed pity.</p>

<p>“It looked good,” he confided to Dave cheeringly.
“Let’s have it again. Come on, Dave!” But Babe’s
words were belied by the signal hidden under the
big mitten, and what followed was so palpably a
straight ball in the groove that the batter swung
smartly—and missed badly.</p>

<p>“Two and two!” proclaimed the official.</p>

<p>“Nice work, Dave!” shouted Babe. “That’s
pitching, boy! One more now!”</p>

<p>Babe’s voice was almost drowned by the strident
cries of the coachers. Even the Munson bench was
howling advice and encouragement. The runner on
third was for an instant still, under the conditions
a suspicious circumstance and suggesting a dash for
the plate on the next pitch. Dave glanced unconcernedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
toward the last station, studied Babe’s
signal, hesitated, shook his head. Babe signaled
anew. Dave nodded. All this was merely to give
the batsman something to think about besides his
job of hitting the ball on the nose, for Dave seldom
refused Babe’s signals, and when he did he didn’t
shake his head at them but walked toward the plate
and held a whispered conference with the catcher.
The incident worried the coach a mite, too, and he
had half a mind to cancel his signal for an attempted
steal from third. But he didn’t, and as Dave’s hand
holding the ball went back the runner shot for the
plate.</p>

<p>Dave didn’t hurry his delivery, although the form
of the scuttling runner was plain to his sight as his
arm shot forward. The ball went true to its goal,
the batter started to swing and changed his mind,
the ball thudded into Babe’s mitten and the umpire
swung an arm outward and backward.</p>

<p>“He’s out!” The runner from third slid into the
base in a cloud of yellow dust, his performance a
wasted effort.</p>

<p>In the stand the little group of Holman’s rooters
stood and yelled themselves red of face, and between
the plate and the Holman’s bench a youth pushed a
cap to the back of his very red head and spun ecstatically
on one heel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Ginger had kept his emotions sternly in check
throughout eight and a half innings, presenting a
cheerful, untroubled countenance to the world, performing
his duties with all his accustomed masterly
efficiency. But now relief demanded expression, and
he spun on a worn heel and was inarticulately joyful.
Then he was at Babe’s side, hand outstretched
for mask and mitt, saying casually:</p>

<p>“Atta-boy, Babe! ’At’s holding ’em!”</p>

<p>Babe grinned as he unbuckled the strap of his
protector. “Get a good grip on your lucky dime,
Ginger, and root for the old bridge timber!” said
Babe.</p>

<p>Ginger looked startled. Gee, Babe was right,
though! Joe Kenton was up, and then came Mac,
Bud, and Babe. Ginger hoped hard that the needed
run wouldn’t depend on Babe, for Babe had faced
the enemy three times and had failed on each occasion
to hit. More than that, it was Cross who was
now pitching, and only yesterday morning Babe had
acknowledged that never yet, this year or any other,
had Cross allowed him a bingle. For Cross knew
Babe’s weakness and didn’t have to have the catcher
tell him to keep them low and inside.</p>

<p>“Batter up!” called the umpire impatiently, and
Joe, who had been listening with bent head to
Coach Cousins’ instructions, straightened and walked
to the plate very jauntily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“You got one comin’ to you, Joe,” said Ginger,
as he rescued the bat relinquished by the left fielder.
“Bust it on the nose!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>GINGER SIGNS UP AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Ginger returned the discarded bat to the
orderly array near the bench, sank to one
knee beside it and watched anxiously. It
was evident that Cross meant to send that game to
extra innings. He was slow and canny, studying the
batsman, gripping the ball with more than usual
nicety. Ginger observed Joe Kenton and frowned
slightly. It was plain to him that Joe had been instructed
to bunt, and Ginger didn’t approve of the
bunting game. Of course an occasional bunt was
all right, if the other fellow wasn’t looking for it,
or you wanted to pull a player out of position, but
Ginger believed in forcing the issue, in going after
the ball hard. “They’ll look for a bunt and he won’t
have a Chinaman’s chance,” Ginger reflected. “That
third baseman’s playing in for him right now. Gee,
I wish he wouldn’t!” “He” in Ginger’s thoughts
was Joe, and not the third baseman. The boy turned
and shot an almost imploring glance at Gus Cousins,
but the coach’s gaze was on the game. Then came
the tragedy, and quite as Ginger had pictured it.
Joe loosened his bat and thrust it in the path of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
first delivery. The ball trickled slowly toward third.
It was a nice bunt and, unexpected, might have won
him first base. But the player on third came in at top
speed, scooped up the rolling ball and, in the same
motion, sped it to first. Joe was beaten by six feet!</p>

<p>One down! But Ginger maintained his cheerfulness
as he took the bat from the disgusted Joe.</p>

<p>“Hard luck! Robbery, I call it!” Mac Torrey
faced the pitcher now. Mac was no bunter, even had
Gus elected to cling to the bunting game, and Ginger
looked for something to happen. And as he looked
his mind was busy with the future. Babe, untroubled,
lolled on the bench, one big arm over
Dave’s shoulders. Ginger frowned a trifle as he
returned his gaze to the drama before him. If Mac
got his base and Bud went out and it was up to Babe—Ginger
sighed and shook his head.</p>

<p>One ball, and then a strike at which Mac did not
offer. A second ball. Cross was working deftly and
easily, very much master of the situation as it
seemed. A fourth delivery sped to the plate, a lazy
ball that looked good until it began to curve outward
and down. Mac swung hard and missed by inches.
Ginger gave a little groan and his gaze shot sideways
to where Babe’s black-handled bat lay close to his
hand. Then he got to his feet, unnoted by any one,
probably, on field or seats, and wandered along the
edge of the stand toward the nearly empty press box.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Short of it, he stopped and leaned with one elbow on
the edge and watched the plate while Cross’s fifth
delivery was met by Mac and sent arching over the
first base pavilion. Then, quite as unobtrusively as
he had left his place, Ginger loitered back to the end
of the bench and again subsided to a knee. And just
then Mac swung innocuously and the umpire waved
him away and there were two down!</p>

<p>“You’re next, Babe!” called the manager as Bud
Thomas went to the plate. Ginger’s heart stood still
for an instant and then raced very hard. He was
pawing over the bats as Babe arose.</p>

<p>“Give us the old bridge timber, son,” said Babe
cheerfully, “and rub the lucky dime!”</p>

<p>Ginger raised a pale countenance on which the
freckles stood out with strange prominence. “It—it
ain’t here, Babe,” he answered, his voice a little
husky in spite of his effort to make it sound natural.</p>

<p>“Where is it, then?” demanded Babe, his gaze
searching the ground. “What have you done with
it, son?” He looked to see if by some strange
chance Bud had chosen it, but Bud hadn’t. Ginger
was searching behind the long bench, and under it,
and around the water bucket. Others joined the
search. Captain Hal bent a curious look on Ginger,
which Ginger met and quickly avoided. It was
Manager Naylor who suggested a solution.</p>

<p>“Maybe it got mixed up with their bats,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Bert, nodding across the diamond toward the enemy
headquarters. “Run over and see, Ginger.”</p>

<p>And Ginger very gladly went. But it wasn’t
there, and he returned breathlessly to Babe and told
him so. And just at that moment Bud leaned
against one of Cross’s curves and the ball made a
gray streak across the infield between second and
third bases. Shortstop made a dive at it and
knocked it down, but it was third baseman who
pegged it to first a long instant after Bud had shot
across the sack. Holman’s took heart and cheered
and shouted, and joy reigned in all patriotic breasts
save that of Babe Linder. Babe was in despair.
From the umpire at the plate came the sharp admonishment
“Come on! Batter up!” Babe gave a last
yearning look at the array of bats spread before him
and dazedly accepted the one that Ginger held forth.</p>

<p>“Babe,” said Ginger earnestly, “don’t swing too
hard, will you? This bat’s got a lot of pep to it.
Just meet ’em sharp like, Babe. Do you get me?
You ain’t going to miss that other bat, honest!
You—”</p>

<p>Babe looking down read something in Ginger’s
face that made him stop on his way to the plate.
“Oh,” he said softly, “so that’s it!” He was
smiling, but it was a grim, tight sort of smile and
Ginger’s heart sank. “This is your doings, eh? All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
right, Ginger, but when this game’s done I’m going
to find you, and I’m going to—”</p>

<p>“Say!” interrupted the umpire wrathfully, “I’ll
give you just ten seconds to get in the box! What
do you think this is, a cricket game?”</p>

<p>Babe went on, parting from Ginger with one last
long, meaningful look, and took his place beside the
rubber. He was exceedingly angry as he set his
feet well apart and squared himself to the plate.
The ridiculous thing in his hands had no weight,
no substance, as he swung it back and waited. He
felt helpless, as helpless as Hercules himself might
have felt if some one had stolen his good old club
and substituted a willow wand!</p>

<p>“Lose your bat?” inquired the Munson catcher
affably as he straightened up after giving his signal.</p>

<p>“Yes,” growled Babe morosely. “Some murdering
thief—”</p>

<p>But there wasn’t time for more, because a grayish-white
object came speeding toward him. Babe kept
his eyes on it until it became a blur to his vision, but
made no offer at it. It was much too low; way
under his knees, and—</p>

<p>“<em>Stuh-rike!</em>” intoned the umpire. Babe turned
upon him indignantly.</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>” he demanded, outraged.</p>

<p>There was no reply beyond a baleful glance from
the cold gray eyes of the official. Babe grunted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
waved that useless weapon twice across the plate
and grimly set himself again. From the bench came
encouraging advice. “Make him pitch to you,
Babe!” “It only takes one, old son!” “Let’s have
it, Babe! You’re better than he is!” A palpable
ball went past, but Babe breathed easier when the
umpire called it by its right name. Cross pegged
twice to first, where Bud was taking long chances
on the path to second, got no results and again gave
his attention to Babe. Then the signal came and
Babe’s big fingers clutched more tightly about the
inadequate handle of the toy weapon. The ball sped
toward him and Bud started, hot foot, for second.
Babe swung, putting all his force of weight and
muscle into action. The infield was shouting loudly
as Babe’s bat, meeting no opposition, swung right
on around, taking Babe with it. Then the Munson
catcher stepped forward and threw, straight and
true but high, to shortstop. Ball and Bud reached
the bag at the same instant, but Bud was saved by
the fraction of time required by the shortstop to
bring the ball from above his head to the level of
his shoe tops. Holman’s cheered, Bud arose carefully
and patted a cloud of dust from his togs and
Cross viewed the runner venomously ere he stepped
back into the box.</p>

<p>Two strikes and one ball, reflected Babe. He
had forgotten to allow for the difference in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
weight of his bat that time and had swung too soon.
It had been a good ball, if a trifle lower than Babe
liked them, and he would have got it if he hadn’t
been too quick. But what could you do with a
matchstick, anyway? What was it Ginger had said?
“That bat’s got a lot of pep to it. Just meet ’em
sharp like.” Drat the red-headed little rascal!
Maybe his advice was good, though. Babe guessed
it was. Maybe, next time, if he held back a little—</p>

<p>The next time came. Cross had balls to spare,
but something whispered to Babe that the long-legged
pitcher was eager to end the innings, that he
meant to close the incident with his next delivery.
Babe had forgotten his anger now. He was the old
calm, cool-headed Babe. Something of his accustomed
confidence returned as he narrowed his
eyes slightly and poised that inadequate bat. Cross
stepped forward, his hand shot toward the plate, the
ball sped from it, grew bigger, hung for a brief
moment in air as though motionless and then was at
the plate.</p>

<p>“Just meet it sharp!” said Babe to himself. Then
his bat swept around in what for Babe was scarcely
more than a half-swing, there was a sharp <em>crack</em>, and
ball and batsman were off at the same instant. And
so was Bud, his legs twinkling as he sped for third.
The ball streaked, low and at lightning speed,
straight across the base line midway between first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and second. After its passage first baseman and
second baseman picked themselves up from the turf
and raced to their bags. In right field a frantic
player cupped his hands before the rolling ball,
straightened and threw desperately to the plate. But
Bud’s spikes spurned the rubber just as the ball
began its long bound, and before the sphere had
settled into the catcher’s mitten Holman’s shouts
proclaimed victory and Bud, breathless but happy,
was fighting his way to the bench through a mob of
frantic friends.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, seated beside Babe on the
dusty red velvet of a day-coach, Ginger was making
confession. “It was an awful nervy thing to do,
Babe, but, gee, I just had to! Honest, I did, Babe!
Look at the fix we was in. We only needed the one
run to cop the game, didn’t we? And you ain’t
never come through in the pinches with that bat,
Babe, have you? Didn’t you say yourself that you
ain’t never made a hit off that Cross guy? Sure, you
did! I just knew you’d go in there and try to slug
out a homer, if you had that big club, Babe, and we
didn’t need no homer to win, see? All we needed
was just a nice little hit, Babe, like a fellow would
make if he just took a short swing and hit the old
apple clean. So I says ‘If he don’t have the old
bridge timber he’ll have to use one of the other bats,
and maybe thataway he’ll come through.’ And so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
when you wasn’t lookin’ I hid the old blackjack in
the stand. Believe me, I was scared! And if—”</p>

<p>“Believe me,” interrupted Babe very, very fiercely,
“you had a right to be scared, for I certainly
intended to crown you for fair, son!”</p>

<p>Ginger grinned and edged a wee bit closer to the
big chap. “Aw, gee,” he said, “I wasn’t caring
about no lickin’, Babe. What I was scared of was
maybe you wouldn’t make no hit, after all! But you
did, didn’t you, Babe?”</p>

<p>“Sure did,” agreed Babe cheerfully.</p>

<p>“An’—” Ginger’s tone became insinuating—“an’,
say, Babe, them light bats ain’t so worse, are they?”</p>

<p>Babe turned a stern countenance on the criminal.
“Lay off that, son, lay off,” he replied. “That bat
did the trick for me that time, all right. But, as you
said to me not so long ago, Ginger, that don’t prove
nothing, nothing at all!”</p>

<p>But Ginger, catching the twinkle in Babe’s eyes,
thought differently.</p>

<p>The team’s banquet was held at Mander’s Chesapeake
Oyster House, in the upstairs room where the
ceiling was so low that Babe threatened to bring
down the plaster whenever he stood up. All the
players were there, and the Coach and the Manager
and the Assistant Manager and—Ginger! Ginger
was there, of course, in his official position of
Mascot, and just at first he was far too embarrassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to take joy from the occasion. But he pulled himself
together, in a way of speaking, along about the
second course and, perhaps just to prove that he was
quite accustomed to banquets—which of course he
wasn’t—he finished strong, eating his own three-colored
ice cream and Babe’s and Ted Purves’.</p>

<p>Naturally, Ginger had no vote in the election
which followed, though it is likely enough that he,
too, would have cast his vote for Joe Kenton. Joe,
however, didn’t need any more votes than he got on
the first and only ballot taken, for his election was
unanimous. Hal, privileged as retiring captain to
nominate a successor, said so many splendid things
about his chum that Joe got very red in the face and
looked extremely unhappy until the last cheer for the
new leader had died away. Later they sang some
songs and felt a trifle sentimental, especially fellows
who, like Babe and Hal, wouldn’t be there next year,
and at last the banquet came to an end. Many of
the fellows seized on suitcases and hurried off for the
late train. Others, Joe and Hal and Babe amongst
them, went slowly back to school through the warm
June night. Ginger, loath to see the last of his
friend and hero, tagged along at Babe’s side, and
when Routledge was reached allowed himself to be
persuaded to ascend to Number 14.</p>

<p>Up there, with the windows open and coats off,
they sat and talked long. No one, it seemed, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sleepy even when eleven o’clock struck. But Ginger
pulled himself from Babe’s side and said he guessed
he’d have to be getting along or the old man would
whale the hide off him! They shook hands very
gravely with him and Joe said: “Well, see you next
year, Ginger.”</p>

<p>Then, to the others’ surprise, Ginger shook his
head. “I don’t guess you will,” he said gruffly.</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Babe. “Going to desert us?”</p>

<p>“Aw, you won’t be here,” answered Ginger, his
gaze on the floor.</p>

<p>“Why, no, old man, I won’t, but Joe will, and a lot
of the others. Great Scott, kid, you can’t desert the
old team like that!”</p>

<p>“Of course you can’t,” said Joe. “Besides,
Ginger, it’s pretty likely that Babe’ll be back here
now and then, and if you want to see him you’d
better hang about the old field. And, gee, Ginger,
I was counting on your help! It isn’t going to be
any easy job next year, with so many of the old
players gone, and—well, I’m going to need you,
Ginger.”</p>

<p>Ginger hesitated, looked at Joe, darted a glance at
Babe and at last spoke.</p>

<p>“Aw, all right,” he said. “I’ll see the old team
through another season.”</p>

<p class="cap">In September Joe was back again at Holman’s,
three months older, nearly an inch taller than
he had been the preceding fall and a good eight
pounds heavier than when he had left school in June.
Some of those eight pounds, he knew, would come
off when he began running the bases in fall practice,
but he earnestly hoped that most of them would stay
with him. As Hal was no longer there, and, since
he was now a senior, he was privileged to room in
the senior dormitory. He had applied for and been
assigned one of the front studies in Levering Hall.
But in July his plans had been changed. A wierdly
scrawled letter from Gus Billings, written in a
Maine camp, had reached him toward the last of that
month. Gus, himself now without a roommate,
proposed that Joe share Number 10 Puffer. “Maybe
it isn’t as fussy as Levering,” wrote Gus, “but it’s
a good old dive and I’d rather stay there next year
than change, and you’d like it, I’ll bet, if you tried
it.” So Joe joined forces with the big, good-natured
football captain, taking over Babe Linder’s half of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the quarters and becoming heir to one frayed bath
towel, a half-filled bottle of witch-hazel and the
remains of what had once been a blue gymnasium
shirt, these articles being discovered in various out-of-the-way
corners.</p>

<p>Joe missed Hal Norwin a good deal for the first
few days of the new term, but after that there was
scarcely time to miss any one. Fall baseball practice
began on the second day and Joe was busy. He and
Gus got on beautifully right from the start. Any
fellow, though, could get on with Gus, so that was
no great credit to Joe. Gus was even busier than
Joe, and, as football leader, was facing far more
responsibility. Until well into October Joe knew
but little of the football situation. Gus spoke of it
frequently enough, but Joe’s attention was generally
perfunctory. Then, one evening Gus sprang a surprise.</p>

<p>“Say, how much longer are you going to waste
your time with that gang of morons?” he asked.
“Moron” was a new word with Gus, and he loved it.
Joe simulated perplexity.</p>

<p>“Morons, Gus? Why, I’m not on the eleven!”</p>

<p>“No, but you ought to be,” growled Gus. “Look
here, Joseph, we were talking about you this afternoon,
Rusty and I, and we decided you’d have to
come out.”</p>

<p>“Play football? Not on your life! Listen, Gus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
I’ve got all the trouble I want right now. You and
Rusty want to forget it!”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done. We need you. We’re short of
men, as you know, and—”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it,” exclaimed Joe suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Well, you would have if you’d heard what I’ve
been telling you every day for three weeks! We’ve
got a punk lot of backfield stuff, and we need more.
We—”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” laughed Joe.</p>

<p>“We need more men, I mean. You’ve played two
years already, Joe, and you know a lot more than
some of those new morons that are trying for jobs.
You’d be a lot of good out there if you’d come. How
about it?”</p>

<p>“But I can’t, Gus! Who’s going to look after the
baseball gang? There’s a good fortnight of practice
ahead yet. Of course, after that, if you still insist,
I’ll be glad to join your crowd of roughnecks. Just
the same, I don’t see what use I can be. You know
mighty well I’m no football player. I proved that
last year, and—”</p>

<p>“How come? Look at what you did in the Mills
game. Made every score yourself—”</p>

<p>“Shut up! I’m a dub at football, and every one
knows it. What are you and Rusty trying to do,
anyway? String me?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, Joe, honest. Listen. Rusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
says you’d probably get a place this year if you tried
hard. After all, experience is what counts, and
you’ve had two years of it. And you’re a mighty
clever guy when it comes to running, Joe. You’re
fast and you can dodge like a rabbit.”</p>

<p>“Yes, maybe. And I can get the signals twisted
and I can score as well for the other fellow as for
us! I’m a plain nitwit at football, Gus, old darling,
and you ought to know it. So had Rusty. Besides—”
and Joe grinned—“what would I want to
play any more for? I’ve got my letter, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“Letter?” said Gus. “You’ve got three of ’em;
baseball, football and hockey. If it comes to that,
what do you want to play any more baseball for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s different. I’m captain, you see.”</p>

<p>“Sure. And I’m football captain. So you ought
to play football.”</p>

<p>The logic wasn’t quite clear to Joe, but he didn’t
challenge it. He only shook his head again. “Anything
to oblige you, Gus, but my duty is with the
baseball crowd just now.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with letting Prince attend to
’em? What’s fall practice amount to, anyway?
Any one can stand around and see that those guys
get enough work. The job doesn’t need you. Besides,
you could look ’em over now and then, couldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, good Gustavus,” protested Joe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
“what’s the big idea? You’ve got Dave Hearn and
Johnny Sawyer for half-backs, and maybe six or
eight others, haven’t you? Why pick on me?”</p>

<p>“Sure, we’ve got Dave and Johnny and a fellow
named Leary, a new guy, but that’s all we have got.
The rest are a total loss. You know mighty well
three half-backs aren’t enough to carry a team
through a whole season. Johnny’s a fine plunger, a
rattling guy for the heavy and rough business, but
he’s as slow as cold cream when it comes to running.
Dave’s good; he’s fine; but we need a couple others.
You’re one of ’em. When do you start?”</p>

<p>Joe laughed impatiently. “I don’t start, you old
idiot. I’ve told you I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Bet you you do,” replied Gus, untroubledly.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll bet I don’t! At any rate, not until fall
baseball’s through.” There was a moment’s silence
during which Joe found his place in the book he had
been studying. Then he added: “I’m sorry, Gus,
of course, but you see how it is.”</p>

<p>“I thought you liked football,” said Gus. “You
were crazy about it last fall.”</p>

<p>“I do like it. I’m crazy about it yet, I guess, even
if I’ve proved to myself that I’m no player, but—”</p>

<p>“And now, just when you’re practically certain of
making the team, you quit!”</p>

<p>“Practically certain of—say, are you crazy?”</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t you? You’re captain of the baseball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
team, aren’t you? Well, you ought to know
what that means. If I went out for baseball next
spring don’t you think I’d find a place, even if I was
fairly punk? Sure, I would. Just because I’m football
captain. Well, it works the other way, too,
doesn’t it? Any coach will stretch a point to find
a place for a fellow who’s captain in another sport.
Rusty as good as said this afternoon that you’d
get placed if you came out. Of course, that doesn’t
mean that you’d play all the time, but you’d get a
good show and you’d be sure of playing against
Munson for a while anyway.”</p>

<p>“I call that a pretty sick piece of business,” replied
Joe disgustedly. “And if you think it works always,
why, you just try for the nine next spring! You’ll
have a fat chance of making it if you can’t play real
baseball, Gus!”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” chuckled Gus, “but if you left it to the
coach he’d look after me all right!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want a place on the football team
that I don’t earn. And you can tell Rusty so, too.
I’m not coming out, Gus, but if I did I wouldn’t take
any favors like that. That’s—that’s crazy!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t get excited,” said Gus soothingly.
“We’ll let you earn your place, Joe.”</p>

<p>“You bet you will—when you get the chance!”</p>

<p>Joe resolutely cupped his chin in his palms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
fixed his eyes on the book. Gus smiled tolerantly,
sighed and drew his own work toward him.</p>

<p>Two days later Joe reported for football.</p>

<p>There didn’t seem to be anything else to do. The
coach talked to three or four of the leading members
of the nine and convinced them that Captain Kenton
was needed on the gridiron. Then he talked to Joe.
Rusty was a forceful talker, even if his vocabulary
wasn’t large, and at the end of half an hour he had
Joe teetering. And then when the latter, having
exhausted all the objections he could think of, fell
back on Charlie Prince and others of the last year
crowd for support they deserted him utterly. Charlie
expressed amazement that Joe should even hesitate.
He said it was a question of patriotism, a call to the
colors, and a lot more, and Joe surrendered. Charlie
took over the running of the baseball team and Joe,
delighted as soon as he was once convinced, donned
canvas again.</p>

<p>So far Holman’s had journeyed a rough path.
She had played four games and won two of them.
She had had her big moments, when it had seemed
to coach and players and spectators that the Light
Green was due for another successful season, with
Munson’s scalp hanging from her belt in November,
but there had been other moments not so grand.
Saarsburg had fairly overwhelmed her in the third
contest of the season, Holman’s playing football that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
might easily have disgraced a grammar school team.
Some laid that to the fact that the thermometer
hovered around eighty; but it wasn’t to be denied
that it was just as hot for the visiting crowd, and
Rusty, the red-headed Holman’s coach, chewed his
gum very fast and swallowed a lot of things he
wanted to say. Then, just to show what she could
do, the Light Green took Center Hill Academy into
camp to the tune of 23 to 0; and Center Hill
was no infant at the pigskin game! And three days
after that Joe Kenton joined his fortunes with Gus
and Tom Meadows and Slim Porter and the others
and contentedly, if dubiously, proceeded to do his
bit.</p>

<p>It wasn’t much of a bit at first. He was football
stale and it took many days to get back into the rut
again. Rusty gave him plenty of work and plenty
of opportunities, trying him out for a week on the
scrubs and then shifting him over to the first as a
first-choice substitute. He got into the Mills game
for some twenty minutes and, perhaps because Mills
this year was only about fifty per cent of the team
she had been last, he was fairly successful in making
gains outside of tackle. Holman’s won without
much effort, 19 to 0. Afterwards, Gus tried to tell
Joe that he had played a corking game, but Joe knew
better.</p>

<p>“Talk sense,” he protested. “If we’d been playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Munson, or even Glenwood, I wouldn’t have made
fifteen yards this afternoon. With you and
Barrows boxing that end any one could have got
his distance. And I mighty nigh got the signals
mixed again that time on their sixteen yards when
Sanford sent Leary into the line. I was within an
ace of going after the ball myself. If Leary hadn’t
started a split-second before I could get going I’d
have gummed the game finely! No, sir, Gus, I’m
no pigskin wonder, and I know it. I love the pesky
old game and I’ll play it as long as you and Rusty
can stand me, but I haven’t any whatyoucallems—any
delusions of greatness.”</p>

<p>“I don’t say you’re a great player,” demurred Gus,
“but you got away fast and clean to-day, and you
follow the ball, Joe. If there’s one thing I admire
more than anything else in a football guy it’s that.
I’m a prune, myself, at it. I never could keep my
eyes on the old leather, and I’ve missed more tackles
and fell over my own feet oftener than you could
count just for that reason. Yes, sir, you follow the
ball, and I sure like that, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe so, but that doesn’t make me a
player. Any one can watch the pigskin and see
where it’s going—or coming. And, of course, if you
know where it is you stand a fair chance of getting
the runner. But what I mean is that—that oh, I
don’t know!” Joe sighed. “I guess it just comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
down to this, Gus. Some fellows have football
intelligence and a lot more haven’t. And I’m one of
the haven’t!”</p>

<p>“Well, keep the old shirt on,” counseled Gus.
“You’re doing fine. I wouldn’t wonder if we
managed to use you a whole lot against Munson.
They say she’s got only a fair line this year, and a
slow backfield, and you ought to be able to get going
once at least; and when you do get started, Joseph,
you’re hard to stop.”</p>

<p>“A slow backfield!” jeered Joe. “Where do you
get that stuff? Munson’s still got Taylor, and he’s
fast enough for half a dozen backs!”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but the rest are big chaps and don’t handle
themselves very quick. Anyway, that’s the dope we
get. Rusty’s aiming to put a fast team against ’em,
and that’s why I guess you’ll get a good share of
work the day we meet ’em. You keep right on the
way you’re headed, old son, and no one’ll do any
kicking. And keep your eye on the ball just like
you’re doing. You sure do make a hit with me in
that way, Joe!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s nice to know there’s one thing I do
decently,” answered Joe, still deeply pessimistic.
“Too bad there isn’t a twelfth position on a football
team, Gus. I might get on the All-American as ball-follower!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Gus grinned and muttered something as he
lounged through the door. It sounded like
“moron.”</p>

<p>The Mills game marked the end of the preliminary
season. The four games that remained, excepting,
perhaps, that with Wagnalls, a week before the final
test, were serious affairs; and only the most optimistic
Holman’s supporters could figure wins for
the Light Green in more than two of them; and
sometimes those two didn’t include the Munson contest!
Rusty had stopped experimenting now and,
barring accidents, the line-up for the Louisburg
game would be the line-up that faced Munson. One
thing that worried all who dared hope for a victory
over the Blue and Gold was the fact that in all the
seventeen years that Holman’s and Munson had met
on the gridiron never had the former won two
successive contests. Munson had beaten her rival
two years running twice, but such glory had yet to
fall to Holman’s. Holman’s had won last fall, and
while there was, of course, absolutely nothing in
this superstition stuff—well, there it was! Even
Captain Gus, who had as little imagination as any
one could have, was secretly oppressed, although
publicly, if any one referred to the subject, he
laughed scornfully and declared that fellows who put
any faith in that sort of dope were morons!</p>

<p>What Rusty thought no one knew. Rusty kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
right on working hard with such material as Fate
had willed to him, a dogged, determined, generally
cheerful Rusty who was well liked by all hands and
who, knowing what his charges didn’t know, was
working for more than a victory over the ancient
rival. What he knew and the fellows didn’t—or, if
they did know, had forgotten—was that his four-year
term as coach expired this fall, and that, since
like any general, he was judged by results, whether
his contract was renewed would depend a very great
deal on whether Holman’s or Munson emerged from
the fast approaching battle with the long end of the
score. During Rusty’s regime the Light Green had
lost two Munson games and won one, and, although
Rusty might well have cited extenuating circumstances
to account for the first defeat, he realized
fully that another reversal would probably send him
looking for a new position. So the little coach
worked hard, perhaps harder than he ever had
worked, and with material that, to say the best of it,
was only average. If he had had last year’s team
Rusty wouldn’t have worried much, but he hadn’t.
What he had was only little more than half as good
as last year’s, and so, not infrequently, Rusty did
worry. But few ever knew it.</p>

<p>The Louisburg game proved a tragedy both to the
team and to Joe; but especially to Joe. Johnny
Sawyer, playing right half, got a twisted ankle early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in the first period and, for some reason known only
to Rusty, Joe, instead of Leary, was sent in to
replace him. Joe had never been able to do as well
at right half as at left; nor did he play as well
under Clinker’s leadership as under Sanford’s.
To-day it was the substitute quarter who had started,
Sanford being reserved for the last half. Things
broke wrong for Joe on the very first play, which
was a fullback buck through right of center. Instead
of going into the line outside his right tackle as he
should have, Joe dashed straight for the center-guard
hole. He beat Brill, the fullback, to it, but Joe
was too light for the job of cleaning the hole out,
and when Brill slammed in behind him the enemy
defense had flocked to the point of attack and the
result was a three-yard loss for Holman’s. Joe
emerged rather the worse for wear and as yet unconscious
of his error. Clinker, ably assisted by
Brill, informed him of it. There wasn’t much time
for explanations, but the two did wonders, and
Joe, very sick and miserable, would have crawled out
of sight if that had been possible.</p>

<p>He partly redeemed himself a few minutes later
by a lucky catch of the ball when it bounced from
Barrow’s hands after a forward pass. But he laid
that to luck and nothing else, and found no comfort.
Twice he was stopped on plays around his right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
once for a four-yard loss. It wasn’t his day, and he
was convinced of it, and he played as one who was
convinced. On defense he was not so bad, but
Rusty wisely took him out at the end of the quarter.
Joe went over to the gymnasium certain that he was
disgraced. He didn’t return for the rest of the
game, and what happened he learned from Gus later.
After holding Holman’s scoreless during the first
two periods, Louisburg opened up a whole bag of
tricks and, taking the offensive, slammed the opponents
around cruelly, putting two touchdowns across
and adding a field goal for good measure. The
score was 16 to 0. Gus was still dazed when he told
the story.</p>

<p>“We simply went to pieces, Joe, the whole kit and
caboodle of us. Why, even Ferris was up in the air.
Twice he passed over Brill’s head. The rest of us
were just as bad. I was rotten. I don’t know what
happened! We played like a lot of—of morons!”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">That evening Joe sought out Rusty in his
room in the village. “I guess I might as
well quit,” he said. “I’m no good at it,
Rusty, and there’s no sense in my taking the place
of some fellow who can play better. You and Gus
have been mighty decent, but I said when I started
that I didn’t want the job if I couldn’t earn it, and I
haven’t. I’ve heard more or less talk, too. Some
fellows say I’m on just because I’m rooming with
Gus, or because I’m baseball captain. Well, I’d
rather they didn’t think that.”</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do?” asked Rusty.
“Resign?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Joe smiled and added: “Before I’m
fired.”</p>

<p>“Well, your resignation isn’t accepted, Kenton.”</p>

<p>Joe observed the coach doubtfully. “But—but I’m
in earnest,” he protested. “It’s fine of you to be willing
to put up with me, Rusty, but I—I don’t want
you to think that you’ve got to—that is, that you’re
under any obligation to find a place for me on the
eleven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Obligation be blowed,” said Rusty. “What are
you talking about, anyway? I don’t get you,
Kenton.”</p>

<p>“Why, what I mean is—look here, Rusty. You
know that if I wasn’t baseball captain I’d have been
let out two weeks ago. Well, I don’t want to play
football enough to keep my place by favor, and so—”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it,” interrupted Rusty. “I get you
now. So you think I’m nursing you along because
you’re baseball captain, eh?”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Joe, smiling, but uneasy because
of a sudden setting of Rusty’s face, “it’s done, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>Rusty shook his head, his mouth drawn to a grim
line.</p>

<p>“Not this fall, Kenton,” he said.</p>

<p>Joe stared back a moment, and then, as Rusty said
no more, laughed perplexedly. “Well—” he began
vaguely.</p>

<p>“When you aren’t any more use to the team,
Kenton,” announced the coach quietly, “I’ll tell you.
But you wait until I do. If every one of that bunch
who played ragged this afternoon came to me and
resigned I wouldn’t have any team to-morrow.
Good night.”</p>

<p>Joe, still perplexed although greatly relieved, went
back and reported the conversation to Gus. Gus
called him a moron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>A week later Holman’s came back and played a
very decent game against the State Aggies team of
husky, rangy veterans. She was beaten, but only
by a matter of two inches. Which is to say that if
Brill’s second attempt at a goal after touchdown had
sent the pigskin two inches higher it would have
bounded over the bar instead of under. As it was,
the final score was 14 to 13, and as Holman’s had
never hoped for better than a tied score the result
was accepted philosophically. Joe played fairly
well during the twenty-odd minutes that he was in;
rather better on defense than on attack, although he
did get away once for a twelve-yard run that for the
moment made him look almost like a real football
player. One thing he did to the King’s taste—and
Gus’s—was to follow the ball, which accounted for
the fact that he had several fine tackles to his credit.
Joe was not a little set up that evening, although he
tried not to let the fact be known. Gus, who was in
a jovial and expansive mood as a result of having
more than outplayed his opponent, insisted that Joe
was every bit as good as Hearn and “a blamed sight
better than all the other subs!” Joe was pleased, but
sprinkled quite a quantity of salt on the avowal.</p>

<p>There was a week of extremely hard work before
the Wagnalls game. Rusty called always for speed
and more speed. You simply couldn’t satisfy him,
it seemed, and when practice was over the walk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the gymnasium was ten miles long! But the Light
Green certainly showed improvement by the end of
that week. Plays went off more smoothly and a lot
faster, and it did seem as though the team had at
last really found itself. In the Wagnalls game Joe
made his first touchdown, slipping around his own
right end behind the entire backfield and getting
free when Sawyer, playing right half, dumped the
opposing end. Joe started his run from the enemy’s
twenty-seven and had no opposition, once past the
line, save from the Wagnalls quarter. Joe outguessed
that youth very neatly and eluded a desperate
tackle, taking the ball over for the second
score of the game to the plaudits of the Holman’s
rooters. The game was one-sided from the start
and the home team hung up five touchdowns for a
grand total of 34 points while Wagnalls was scoring
7. Joe stayed in a full half and, save that he once
got his signals twisted, comported himself very well.
Even his one lapse went unpenalized since, more by
luck than skill, he got enough ground to make it first
down again.</p>

<p>Then, almost before any one realized it, it was
Thursday and the last practice was over and nothing
was left to do save sit tight and wait for the big
adventure.</p>

<p>Of course there were drills on Friday, both in the
afternoon and evening, but they were designed more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to keep the fellows from getting “edgy” than to
impart instruction. Friday evening Rusty turned
from the blackboard, dusted the chalk from his
hands and spoke for ten minutes very earnestly.
What he said was about what all coaches have said
on the eve of big games since coaches and big games
have been. Followed some rather hysterical cheering
and then twenty-six lads went back to the dormitories
and wooed slumber. Needless to say, a good
many of the number found slumber not easily won.
Rather to his surprise, however, Joe fell asleep
soon after his head touched the pillow, beating Gus
by a good half-hour.</p>

<p>Munson came in numbers, waving blue-and-gold
pennants and cheering lustily as they took possession
of the village. The invaders appeared very certain
of themselves, Joe thought, and his own confidence
lessened appreciably. Even when Gus, viewing the
enemy from the steps of Puffer, scathingly disposed
of them as “a bunch of morons” Joe couldn’t quite
get back his last night’s serenity.</p>

<p>Munson kicked off promptly at two o’clock and
Sanford fumbled the ball on Holman’s sixteen yards,
where an enemy end fell on it. It took Munson just
seven plays to put the pigskin over and hang up
six points to her credit. Holman’s was so overcome
by the initial disaster that her efforts to stop
the enemy’s charges were almost pathetic. Munson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
missed the goal by inches, and Holman’s, taking
what comfort she could, cheered long and loud. Joe
watched that first half of the game from the bench,
Dave Hearn playing left half, and Leary right.
After that first score neither goal line was seriously
threatened until the second period was well along.
Holman’s, recovering from her shock, beat back two
invasions of her territory short of the thirty-yard
line and finally started one of her own. It looked
good until it approached the opposite thirty. Then
it slowed and faltered and, after Brill had failed to
get the ball to Ted Lord on a forward pass, Sanford
sacrificed two yards to get the pigskin in front of
the Munson goal. Brill tried a placement from the
thirty-three, but the ball went far short. Munson
didn’t force the playing after that, but kicked on
second down and was content to let the score stay
as it was until half-time. Twice, however, Holman’s
started off for the enemy goal and made good going
until well past midfield. There the attack invariably
petered out, for the Munson line was strong and
steady. Barring that first misadventure and its
result, the opposing teams played very evenly. If
Munson’s backfield was as slow as Gus had predicted—and
hoped—the fact was not very evident in that
half of the contest. Nor was the Light Green backfield
at all dazzling in its movements. An unbiased
observer would probably have said that neither team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
was playing within thirty per cent of its best, and he
would have been close to the facts. The second
quarter ended with the ball in Munson’s possession
on her own forty-four yards.</p>

<p>In the locker room at the gymnasium, above the
<em>slap-slap</em> of the rubbers, Rusty’s voice dominated
everything, save, perhaps, the pungent odor of rubbing
alcohol and linament, during the last three
minutes of half-time. Rusty had finished with
criticism and instruction. Now he was talking
straight from the shoulder. It was old stuff, but it
sounded new and wonderful, and some of the
younger fellows choked while they listened and
clenched their hands and set their young mouths
sternly. Rusty didn’t get “sloppy,” but he certainly
had them swallowing hard toward the end and sent
them back fighting hot.</p>

<p>As I’ve said before, there was more in it for Rusty
than a mere victory over the hereditary enemy, and
any man who won’t fight hard for his job doesn’t
deserve to hold it!</p>

<p>Joe took Hearn’s place at left half and Sawyer
went in at right end instead of Leary. Slim Porter,
who had been removed in the first period after some
one had stepped ungently on his nose, was reinstated,
well taped of countenance. Otherwise the line-up
was the same as had ended the first half. It took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
four minutes for Holman’s to recover the pigskin
after the kick-off. Then Sawyer pulled down a punt
and was toppled over on his twenty-one yards after
a six-yard dash. Holman’s played better ball then
and played it faster. Sanford abandoned his safety
first policy and called for plays that were ordinarily
held back for desperate moments. For a time they
went well, for Munson found it hard to realize that
the enemy had really cut loose from the former old-style
“hit-the-wall” plays. When she awoke Holman’s
was on her thirty-five-yards and still coming.
But nothing came of that advance in the end. Some
one was caught off-side and the invader was set back
five yards. <a href="#i_frontis">Then Hap Ferris made a</a> low <a href="#i_frontis">pass to
Sawyer</a> and the best Sawyer could do was make it
safe for an eight-yard loss. In the end Brill again
tried a place-kick and again failed, and the ball was
Munson’s on her twenty.</p>

<p>Joe had taken his share of the work and had been
as successful as Sawyer, but his gains had been short.
Getting away from the Munson secondary defense
was not an easy feat. Always he was nabbed after
three yards or four, or, as on one memorable occasion,
seven. The third quarter wore toward its end
without more scoring. Once Munson tried a desperate
drop-kick from the thirty-two yards, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
went wide. With four minutes of that third period
left, however, the unexpected happened.</p>

<p>Munson had slipped in two substitutes, a right
guard and a left half-back, and, not to be outdone,
Rusty had responded by replacing Ferris with
Halliday at center. Hap had been used rather
roughly, if one judged by appearances! Munson
had the ball on Holman’s forty-two yards on second
down when the unexpected came to pass. She had
made a scant two past Captain Gus and now she was
evidently aiming at the same place. But the new
half-back, fresh from the bench, a rangy, tow-headed
lad just oozing enthusiasm, muffed the pass. There
was a frenzied shriek of “<em>Ball!</em> <em>Ball!</em>” and a wild
scramble at the left of the enemy line. Then Joe
ducked through on the other side, past a guard
whose attention had momentarily strayed, gathered
the trickling oval up from under the feet of the
enemy and—went back again!</p>

<p>Going back again was a masterpiece of subtle
strategy, for he was aided by the selfsame guard
who, finding an enemy inside his territory, promptly
thrust him toward whence he had come, failing to
observe until too late the fact that the enemy was
taking the ball with him! Once free from the
guard’s attentions, Joe dug his cleats and left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
locality just as fast as his legs would let him, which
was quite fast. When the lost ball was at last discovered,
which was within a much shorter period
of time than has been consumed in telling it, it was
well on its way toward the Munson goal line. Joe
had cleared the enemy right end unchallenged. Confusion
and pandemonium reigned, and twenty-one
players and at least two officials did their level best
to catch up with Joe. But that was rather a hopeless
undertaking, for Joe had secured a fine start. When
he crossed the goal line, after a brisk dash of fifty-odd
yards, he was practically unattended. There was
a great deal of shouting going on as Joe breathlessly
placed the pigskin on the ground and draped himself
about it.</p>

<p>Various green-stockinged youths pounded or
squeezed from Joe’s body what little breath remained
in it, and then Gus had his go and babbled something
about “following-the-ball-I’ll-say-so-what-do-you-know-about-it-you-old-thief-eh!”
And all the
while he whanged Joe on the back and grinned from
ear to ear. Then comparative silence fell while Brill
tried to boot the pigskin over the bar for the much-needed
one point and the Munson crowd came charging
through and spoiled the whole business! That
was disappointing, but at least the score was even
and there was still another period. Joe was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
when the quarter ended a minute later, for he could
rinse out his mouth at the water pail and get some air
back into his lungs.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, or maybe eleven—I am
speaking of playing and not elapsed time—it had
become generally accepted that 6 to 6 was to be the
final score of that game. Each side was trying hard
to be philosophical and keep in sight the fact that
a tied score was better any day than a defeat. One
thing had been shown very conclusively, which was
that, eliminating accidents, neither team was able to
score against the other. Each might advance the
ball to its opponent’s thirty-five or even thirty, but
beyond that point there was no going. Of course
accidents had happened and might happen again,
but one couldn’t depend on them. Since the last
period had started there had been several fumbles
and near fumbles, for each team was now leavened
with second and third-string players, but the resultant
advantages to the opponent had been slight.
There had been penalties inflicted, too, but they had
been inflicted impartially. So far as present results
went, Holman’s and Munson were just where they
had been when they started, absolutely even. Some
fifty-five minutes of playing time had brought
advantage to neither the Light Green or the Blue
and Gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe was still in, and so was Sawyer, but Brill had
gone and Sanford had gone and there were two
substitutes on the ends and three strange backs
between them. Both teams were still fighting hard
and desperately, but they were slowing up fast.
Under Clinker’s leadership Holman’s lacked its
former aggressiveness and even Gus’s husky imploring
couldn’t put speed into the Light Green.
There was a good deal of punting now and many
rather hopeless attempts at forward passes. Most of
the latter grounded, but finally Clinker did get a
short heave over the center of the line to his right
end and the latter made a half dozen strides before
he was obliterated. That put the ball on Munson’s
forty-eight. Joe tried a run outside his own left
tackle and was stopped and Sawyer got three
through the center. Then Sawyer failed to gain
and Norman, who had taken Brill’s job, punted
over the goal line. Some one proclaimed three minutes
to play as Munson lined up on her twenty. One
easily stopped plunge at the left of center, and Munson
booted from her ten-yard line. It was a short
punt and it went out at the thirty-seven. The Holman’s
stands came to life again with a hoarse cheer
of triumph. Norman got a scant yard and Sawyer
took two. Then Joe scampered wide around his
right and added two more before he was run out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
bounds. It was fourth down and, since Norman was
no field-goal kicker, he punted from near the forty.
By some freak of fortune the ball went the whole
way and again fell behind the goal line, and again
Munson touched it back and brought it out to her
twenty. The time keeper said one minute and
forty seconds.</p>

<p>Well, much may happen in one and two-thirds
minutes, and in this particular one and two-thirds
minutes much did. Munson decided to take no risk
and her left half went back to kicking position.
Very, very desperately Holman’s strove to break
through and block that punt, but just as desperately
the Blue-and-Gold line held her off. Yet the
Holman’s determination had its effect. The enemy
center passed low and the punter was hurried. The
ball went high in the air and there a vagrant breeze
took it and wafted it back toward the Munson goal.
When it descended it was no further from where it
had begun its flight than the twenty-five-yard line.
It was Norman who claimed it, although half the
Holman’s players might have caught it as easily.
The Munson ends, indeed most of the Munson team,
were waiting to down the catcher. Which was
friend and which was enemy was very hard to determine
in that moment. Then the ball came down,
lazily, turning end over end. Norman stepped back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
a foot or so, ready to seize it and plunge ahead. Perhaps
he thought too much of the plunge and not
enough of the catch, for the ball came down not
into his hands but against his shoulder. From there
it arched to the left, well out of the congested
district, on a ten-yard flight.</p>

<p>Joe had been watching the ball quite as attentively
as any one, perhaps more attentively since watching
the ball had become something of a habit with him,
but he had not pushed into the mêlée. Instead,
he was well to the left of it, and from there he was
better able to follow the ball’s supplementary flight.
Consequently, when he saw it coming in his direction
he met it half way. He didn’t have to fight for its
possession, for the nearest claimant was fully three
yards distant when he wrapped his hands about it.
Between him and the goal lay some twenty-seven
yards and, theoretically speaking, eleven enemies.
Actually only about half that number were in position
to dispute his passage, but they were earnest and
determined, and Joe’s work was cut out for him.
He sidestepped one, and then another. One of his
own team disposed of a third and then Joe was
dodging this way and that, now perilously close to
the side line, but always going ahead and putting
one white streak after another behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>He was close to the ten when disaster almost overtook
him in the shape of a hurtling Munson Lineman.
If the enemy had come at him in less haste
the result might have been different. As it was, the
Munson fellow’s idea appeared to be to knock Joe
flat by the force of the concussion and make his
tackle afterwards. That is where he made his mistake,
for, although they met and Joe staggered from
the impact, the latter avoided more than half the
force of the other’s body by spinning on his heel.
There was one second of suspense after that when
Joe felt a hand at his ankle, but he was able to pull
away before the clutching fingers found a hold.
Then the enemy was all about him, it seemed, and he
had the ball against the pit of his stomach, his head
down and his feet pushing the last few yards of
trampled turf behind him. The truth is that, at the
end, there were far more friends than foes around
him, and that Joe’s final heroic effort to cross the
line was made with Gus Billings fairly butting him
on! But cross it he did, and that is the main thing!</p>

<p>And while Holman’s went crazy with joy and
flocked, dancing and cavorting, along the side line,
while Joe fought for breath that wouldn’t come,
while cheers for the Light Green assaulted the sky,
Norman, who had seldom if ever kicked a goal
in all his life, now, just because no one cared whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
he succeeded or didn’t, sent the pigskin over the
bar as prettily as if the game depended on it!</p>

<p>There were many happy persons around school
that evening. There was the whole student body in
general, and there were the members of the team in
particular. And then there was Gus, who declared
a great many times that any one who had ever said
that Joe wasn’t a great football player was nothing
more or less than a moron! Because, no matter
how good a guy was, if he didn’t follow the ball—</p>

<p>And, of course, there was Joe himself, who, while
giving Luck its due, still dared to take a little credit
for what had happened.</p>

<p>And then there was Rusty.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
